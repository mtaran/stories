NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The recording session began on April tenth, nineteen seventy-five at eight twenty-four in the morning with investigator Carl setting up audio recording equipment.

Tony, a four-year-old boy, was present with his investigator for a session described as prior to his departure for school.

As the recording started, Tony showed curiosity about the equipment, asking initial questions about what was happening around him.

The investigator tested the recording by asking Tony if he could hear sounds from the equipment.

Tony confirmed he could hear the investigator, demonstrating early engagement with the recording process.

The investigator formally documented the session details, stating the date and time for the recording record.

The investigator explained that he was with Tony Charlot and described the situation as prior to the child's departure for school.

Tony tested whether he could hear both the investigator and others present, confirming the equipment was working.

The investigator asked Tony about a birthday card, which seemed to be an object of interest in the room.

Tony's father, Miguel, was present in the room and was introduced as one of the participants in the recording session.

The investigator asked the family about the birthday card, suggesting it was something they should discuss or show.

Tony reported that his microphone had come down, indicating the equipment was not staying in place as intended.

The father clarified that Tony had been playing with the microphone, which caused it to slip from its position.

The investigator asked if the microphone was positioned too close to Tony's mouth, trying to diagnose the technical issue.

Tony acknowledged that the microphone placement was indeed a problem that needed correction.

The investigator asked the father if he understood the name correctly, confirming they would be recording Tony Charlot.

Tony's father joked that he momentarily thought the investigator was talking about a place rather than confirming the name.

The investigator mentioned that he had seen pictures Tony had drawn when he was on the fifteenth floor at another location.

The investigator explained that one of the pictures had Tony's last name on it, and someone named Heidi had asked about it.

Tony mentioned a cat that he had drawn, proudly claiming ownership of that artwork when his father asked about the drawings.

The investigator and family discussed Tony's artistic abilities and the content of his drawings.

Tony was instructed to talk more actively during the recording session rather than being quiet.

The investigator encouraged Tony to be the main speaker, saying the one supposed to talk was Tony, not the investigator himself.

Tony said that some glass was broken, using the word 'buster' which the investigator asked him to clarify.

After clarification, Tony explained that all the glass in the room was broken.

The investigator was talking into his microphone and Tony giggled about the situation.

When the investigator asked about Tony's microphone, Tony said 'no sense,' which the investigator tried to understand through repeated questioning.

After several exchanges, both the investigator and Tony settled on understanding that Tony meant 'no sense.'

Tony then said it was time for them to go because he knew he had to depart for school at eight forty.

The investigator corrected Tony, saying it was not yet eight forty and they still had time.

Tony asked why there were two receivers in the setup, curious about the recording equipment design.

The investigator explained that the receivers allowed them to go into another room and still be able to talk and have the conversation recorded.

Tony tested the microphone by asking if the investigator could hear him, confirming the audio was being captured.

The investigator assured Tony that he could hear him clearly, establishing confidence in the equipment.

Tony's father asked Tony about his Hot Wheels toy, wanting to know where he had left it.

Tony responded that his toy was on the carpet, indicating the location where he had placed it.

Tony's mother arrived and asked if Tony was ready to get his hair combed as part of his morning routine.

Tony responded that he thought so, showing some uncertainty about whether he was ready for the grooming activity.

The father told Tony that he would need to have lunch after getting his hair combed.

The mother asked about the lunch situation, seeking clarification from the father about timing and plans.

The father noted that Tony talked so loud that even with the microphone setup, the investigator could still hear him clearly.

The father addressed Tony, saying he needed to talk more quietly but in a way that indicated the equipment was working well.

The investigator spoke in Japanese, possibly testing whether Tony would respond to different languages.

Tony did not respond to the Japanese phrases but instead called out to Carl, the investigator's name.

The investigator responded warmly and positively to Tony's address.

Tony's father asked the investigator how it was outside, inquiring about weather conditions.

The investigator described the weather as mild despite wind conditions.

The investigator stated that the temperature was in the low thirties, providing specific information about the morning.

The father asked if it was colder than the previous day, wanting to know if the weather had changed.

The investigator replied that the current day was a bit warmer than the day before.

Tony's mother asked whether Tony should have his blue shirt on or off, relating to his preparation for school.

The father explained that they would need to take off Tony's current shirt so his mother Angela could put on his sweater.

The father mentioned that once Tony had his sweater on, his mother could comb his hair.

The investigator announced that another operation needed to be performed on the recording equipment setup.

The investigator repeatedly said 'wait a second' to ensure everyone was ready for the adjustment.

The investigator announced he would temporarily take off Tony's shirt to complete the microphone repositioning.

Tony asked where the investigator would put the microphone during this adjustment process.

The investigator explained that he would put the sweater on Tony first and then place the microphone on top of it.

Tony asked what would happen after the sweater was on, wanting to understand the complete sequence.

Tony then asked if the microphone would go in his coat, trying to anticipate the next steps.

The investigator confirmed that the microphone would indeed go in the coat after the sweater was on.

Tony said 'okay let me go get my sweater,' taking initiative to participate in his own preparation.

The investigator asked Tony which sweater he was going to wear, confirming his choice of clothing.

Tony said he would wear the sweater but noted he would be hot every time he wore it.

Tony asked if the investigator would keep the microphone equipment after the session.

The investigator said he would take it back tomorrow, answering Tony's concern about whether he would lose the equipment.

Tony expressed that he wanted to keep the microphone, showing attachment to the recording equipment.

Tony's father jokingly asked Tony if he had gone to bed very late the previous night.

The father commented that he had seen Tony blinking his eyes whenever he walked by, suggesting Tony was struggling to stay awake.

The father posed a humorous question about 'the big idea,' suggesting Tony had no good reason for staying up late.

Tony and his father discussed the Groucho Marx gesture of raising eyebrows to accompany the phrase 'you see, you see.'

The father explained that this was a gesture that a friend of theirs who visited would make to Tony frequently.

The mother told the father to let her finish combing Tony's hair, indicating she was actively working on his grooming.

The investigator asked if he could put something in place, requesting permission from the family.

The father agreed, allowing the investigator to continue with the equipment adjustments.

Tony and the investigator discussed going to school, with Tony indicating willingness to go.

The investigator confirmed they would indeed be going to school.

Tony clarified that the investigator would be walking with him but not attending school himself.

The investigator helped roll up the receivers to ensure they would not get in the way during the journey to school.

Tony asked if the investigator would walk him to school.

The investigator said he would walk with Tony and noted that Tony's father would be walking with him too.

Tony observed that he had something on his feet, possibly referring to the microphone equipment or clothing.

Tony asked if someone would comb his hair, and his father confirmed he would do so once the current grooming was complete.

Tony's mother indicated she would finish combing his hair soon as she was still working on his appearance.

Tony said 'here comes the bear' in a playful manner, creating imaginative commentary about the situation.

Tony's mother asked if Tony was going to school and when he would be picked up.

Tony asked who would take him to the babysitter, indicating he knew he would need to go there after school.

The mother said she would pick him up, providing Tony with the assurance he was seeking.

Tony asked his mother why she would do that, curious about her commitment to picking him up.

Tony said because he wanted his mother to be the one picking him up.

The mother asked what Tony was doing, checking on his activity level during the preparation.

Tony mentioned something about making 'waters that you pour into yourself,' referring to a school craft activity.

The mother seemed to understand what Tony was talking about and acknowledged his description.

Tony asked what they would be doing next week, showing interest in upcoming school activities.

Tony mentioned wanting to make a butterfly but expressed uncertainty about participating.

Tony mentioned that some kids might be noisy and expressed concern about this possibility.

Tony said he would need to show his bone or demonstrate something about his bones and body.

Tony asked his mother if bones could melt, demonstrating curiosity about his own body.

The mother did not directly answer but instead compared bones to jello, providing a vivid explanation.

Tony seemed to understand this explanation with acknowledgment and vocalizations.

Tony asked if his skin would melt, continuing his line of inquiry about physical changes in the body.

Tony posed another hypothetical question about what would happen if his bones fell out.

The mother tried to address Tony's concerns about his body and its functions in a reassuring manner.

Tony asked his mother if she would pick him up from school the next day, seeking confirmation about future arrangements.

The mother indicated she did not yet know whether she would be available the next day.

The investigator showed the family something that appeared to be a book or magazine.

The investigator mentioned a phrase that seemed humorous or unusual from the reading material.

Tony's father responded with interest, asking if that was what the investigator was showing him.

The investigator affirmed and noted that it was pretty silly content.

The father commented that the book seemed ingenious, responding with humor to the content.

The investigator joked about having a degree, suggesting the unusual content seemed beneath his education level.

The father made a joke about planting something from the book to see if it would grow.

The investigator mentioned a book titled 'The Sexual Life of Savages,' which was a real academic work.

The father noted that the family seemed to get into heavy or serious topics.

The investigator commented that the family seemed to enjoy reading unusual or academic materials.

The investigator explained how the recording equipment worked, discussing the meaning of different colored lights.

The investigator noted that when the red light came on, it indicated a weak signal from the recording.

The investigator explained that different light colors and flashing patterns indicated different recording conditions.

The investigator stated that when the green light was on, everything was working well because it indicated proper voice modulation.

The investigator noted that the amber or another color light sometimes indicated interference in the signal.

The investigator explained that when interference occurred, he had to listen very carefully during transcription.

The investigator said he did not particularly want to go through many tapes with such interference.

The father acknowledged understanding the technical challenges.

The investigator explained that atmospheric conditions changed drastically and could cause signal fading in and out.

The father confirmed that he had noticed the signal fading and coming back at different times.

Tony's father asked if Tony was ready to leave for school.

Tony indicated he was ready to go.

The father told Tony to quit doing something, suggesting Tony was engaging in an activity the father wanted him to stop.

The father mentioned that there were people downstairs, possibly implying they needed to hurry.

The investigator said he would leave the equipment and bring it back, discussing logistics of the recording apparatus.

The father asked if Tony should take off the recording shirt.

The investigator confirmed that Tony should take off the shirt so that when Tony arrived at school, they would not have to worry.

The investigator jokingly asked 'can you dig it?' in a playful manner.

Tony asked what or which shirt, seeking clarification about which one to remove.

The family discussed that the school had to give consent for the recording project.

The father mentioned that he wished the school had told him sooner about any requirements.

The investigator explained that there might not have been anything the father could have done anyway.

The investigator noted that schools and parents sometimes had different points of view on such matters.

The father said the school had seemed agreeable at first.

The investigator noted that the problem might have been more with the teacher than with the principal.

The investigator explained that some teachers felt uncomfortable being observed during the recording sessions.

The investigator stated that he did not care much about what the teachers thought about being observed.

The investigator said that once he was in a recording situation, he did not pay much attention to teachers' reactions.

Tony's father called to Tony, redirecting his attention to something else.

The investigator told Tony to leave something alone and let him handle it.

Tony found something in his backpack and remarked about where his pick had been.

Tony's father asked what Tony was talking about.

Tony said 'my hand,' clarifying what he was referring to.

Tony asked if he had dropped or drawn something about his hand.

The father told Tony that he needed to take better care of the things he did.

The father pointed out something that was torn and in bad condition.

The father told Tony to go ahead with what he was doing, allowing him to continue.

Tony mentioned his last cookie, worried about it being damaged or lost.

The father warned Tony to be careful not to smash his cookie.

Tony said something about the previous day, making an incomplete statement.

The investigator prepared to adjust the microphone, asking Tony to lift his head up for a moment.

Tony expressed concern that his teacher might see the microphone equipment.

The investigator assured Tony that his teacher would not see it because he was not going into school with it exposed.

Tony worried that he was going to school but needed to confirm this plan.

The investigator said they could stick the microphone in Tony's clothing for the time being.

The investigator expressed concern, saying 'oh my god,' apparently because he had put his hand on the cookie.

Tony asked if the cookie had broken, worried about the damage.

The investigator said he put his hand down on it and was not sure if it broke.
