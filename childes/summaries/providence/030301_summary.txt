NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The session begins with the child misbehaving, removing items from a drawer. The mother sets clear boundaries, offering the child choices about whether to sit at a table, on the floor, or go to bed until he can behave properly. The child makes a good choice to sit in his chair, and the mother praises his decision. She offers him peaches that he requested earlier, and he asks for goldfish crackers instead, which the mother explains he must eat lunch first to earn.

The mother and child read books together, starting with "If You Take a Mouse to the Movies." They discuss the story interactively, where the child provides the rhyming words and answers questions about what the mouse asks for. The story covers a chain reaction of desires involving popcorn, a Christmas tree, a snowman, a fort, and snowballs. The child learns cause-and-effect sequencing through the narrative structure.

They transition to a book about vehicles, where the mother teaches the child vocabulary for different types of transportation. The child attempts to identify vehicles like cars, planes, helicopters, trains, boats, tractors, and construction equipment. The mother corrects his pronunciations and provides proper terminology like "propeller plane" and "space shuttle." The child shows enthusiasm but sometimes misidentifies items, calling many things "trucks."

The family reads about church and God, with the mother explaining what happens at church, prayer, hymns, and the Bible. Next, they read "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," where the child participates by identifying the days of the week and foods the caterpillar eats. He learns about the caterpillar's transformation from egg to butterfly through the story.

Afterwards, they shift to playing with toy cars at a gas station. The mother helps set up a parking lot scene, and they engage in pretend play involving filling cars with gas, paying with money, and getting oil changes. The mother introduces vocabulary like "money car" and encourages the child to arrange vehicles in circles, squares, and octagons. She teaches him about traffic patterns and vehicle relationships through the play.

They create geometric shapes with the cars, with the mother asking if the child can make specific formations. The child attempts to follow instructions for circles and squares while the mother praises his efforts. Throughout the session, the mother consistently uses opportunities to teach shapes, numbers, colors, and social skills like sharing and following instructions.
