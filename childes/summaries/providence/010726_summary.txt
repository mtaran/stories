NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother read to the child about Caillou, a character who wanted to play with his daddy.

She narrated how Caillou was sad when his father had to go to work, drew big red cars with crayons, played with his toy cars pushing them fast along the floor making "vroom vroom" sounds, climbed into the car with his teddy bear, and wanted to "drive with daddy forever." The mother read about a farm with animals that didn't want to go to bed, mentioning cows jumping over the moon, lambs leaping through evening air, piglets bouncing and playing all night, horses riding on comets' tails drawing silvery streaks across the sky.

The child and mother played with magnetic letters and numbers, spelling out "Ethan" and "Evans." The child practiced identifying letters like a, e, h, i, j, k, o, p, z, and numbers, with the mother explaining letter sounds and teaching the child rhymes about letters.

They read "Big and Small, Short and Tall" and another book about a kitten, with an orange kitten and gray kittens, and the family dog Kia.

The child and mother engaged in imaginative play with toy trains, shovels, and trucks, discussing front-end loaders, excavators, backhoes, and forklifts.

The child also drew pictures with a pen, including drawings of a dog and mommy's hand.

Throughout the session, the mother managed equipment including a backpack and ball that the child had to wear.
