The child and mother engaged in extensive toy play and book reading during this long session.

They played with a toolbox containing a hammer, screwdriver, saw, axe, and pliers, with the child and mother repeatedly fixing a toy house by clipping and hammering.

The child expressed satisfaction by saying "clip, all done!" The mother read several books including "Pooh Counts to Five," where they counted honey pots with Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, and Tigger.

They read a truck book identifying cement mixers, garbage trucks, fire trucks, bulldozers, forklifts, cranes, dump trucks, backhoes, and tow trucks.

The mother read "Spot Joins the Parade" featuring Grandpa's fire engine, balloons, jugglers, and dancing animals.

They read "The Snowy Day" about Peter making snow angels, snowballs, and a snowman.

They read a baseball book discussing pitchers, catchers, and different bases.

The mother read "The Little Engine That Could" about a small blue engine pulling toys over a mountain.

The child frequently requested more books, and they read about Maisy the character collecting eggs, riding horses, giving drinks, climbing ladders for apples, and sleeping pigs.

Throughout the session, the child occasionally mentioned his backpack and microphone equipment.
