NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother asks Alex if he wants to play with toys and helps him get ready. Alex doesn't want to swing at first but then they swing together with counting and encouragement. The mother plays a game hiding and seeking with Alex. They look for trees and Alex points them out while the mother confirms his sightings.

They go to get the bat and ball for baseball. The mother tosses the ball and Alex tries to hit it but accidentally gets hit in the head. She apologizes and continues the game with encouragement. Alex blows bubbles and watches them float. The mother pushes him on a riding toy and he moves backwards and forwards.

A toy lion appears briefly and Alex tries to handle various toys. The mother helps Alex with a kite and tries to get it to fly but there isn't enough wind. She holds the string while Alex helps. They need wind to fly the kite successfully and the mother points out the kite flying. They're careful not to break it.

Adult visitor AD1 thanks Alex for helping and compliments him. The mother introduces more outdoor toys including rakes and shovels. Alex and the mother use these tools together and the mother demonstrates proper technique. AD1 asks about the big bird shovel and Alex explores it further.
