NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The child and mother spent the day blowing bubbles outdoors in windy conditions.

The mother and grandmother supervised as the child struggled with bubble wands, repeatedly saying "pop pop pop" as bubbles floated away.

They discussed colors of the bubble wands including pink, green, yellow, and orange.

The child became tired and wanted to nap.

They played with farm animals including a cow, pig, lamb, and horse, and played with counting toys putting items in buckets.

The father appeared during the session.

They played with toy trains, discussed a tractor and hay, and the toy train made sounds of "woo woo" and "I'm off the track." The child and mother played a game where the mother sang "had a farm ee-eye-ee-eye-oh" about farm animals.

They discussed a mailman and a mail carrier cleaning the yard.

The child enjoyed playing with the toys and adults tried to keep him engaged with different activities when he seemed tired or grouchy.
