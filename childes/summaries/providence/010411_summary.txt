NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Ethan arrives with his backpack and both he and his mother put on backpacks with cameras and microphones for recording. The mother explains how sound goes into the camera and they sing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" together. They also discuss the moon and stars while drinking bottles.

The mother offers Ethan crayons to draw pictures and they explore his backpack's contents including batteries. When a battery falls on his toe, the mother comforts him and they label the battery as "bad battery." Ethan becomes upset and tearful, accusing his mother of being mean. The mother reassures him while they work through his emotional distress about the accident.

Once Ethan calms down, the mother offers food and they enjoy raisins together. She teaches him about gratitude by demonstrating "no thank you" when he doesn't want to share. They discuss the texture of raisins being chewy and gooey. The mother sings "This Little Piggy" counting Ethan's toes.

They play with various toys including plates and hats. The mother engages Ethan in peek-a-boo games and discusses colors including yellow, green, and purple. They sing "Cock-a-Doodle-Doo" and Ethan becomes startled by roosters and birds. The mother reassures him about a toy ball, explaining it will take care of him.

Ethan scores a goal with a ball and they celebrate his accomplishment. They continue physical play where Ethan becomes stuck and tangled but the mother helps him get unstuck. The mother fixes the backpack wires so Ethan doesn't get tangled again.

The mother helps Ethan draw a picture, first drawing Ethan in red and then drawing himself as purple mommy. They add features like hair, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth showing love. They extend the drawing to include a green snake with a red tongue and discuss animal sounds.

They enjoy reading a book called "Things I Like" which shows pictures of activities like drawing, riding bikes, playing with toys, building sandcastles, attending birthday parties, and going to bed. The mother engages Ethan in detailed conversations about each page. They finish the book and continue reading about a monkey.

Ethan asks for Clifford the dog book and they draw a big red ball for Clifford. They engage in imaginative play where the dog, Clifford, Ethan, and mommy all eat the ball, then kick it for a score. Ethan practices saying "in" and "out" while playing.

The mother shows Ethan toy vehicles including a fire engine with a ladder and police cars. Ethan becomes scared of the police car and the mother helps by building a tunnel with blocks so it can hide inside. They explore the blocks and continue collaborative play.
