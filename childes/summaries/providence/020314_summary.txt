NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Mother plays peek-a-boo games with child and grandmother, asking "where did he go?" and having child count one, two, three to find people.

Mother and child discuss where family members are—grandmother went to work, grandfather is at work, daddy is upstairs, and other relatives are at school.

Mother and child sit at a table with color flashcards, with mother asking child to identify colors (yellow, brown, purple, orange, pink), shapes (triangle, rectangle, square, circle, oval), and objects (ball, gum, bear, bunny, robot, flower, house, truck).

Child practices saying color and shape names loudly when mother encourages him.

Mother compliments child when he correctly identifies colors and shapes, saying "good boy."

Grandmother opens a window because the house feels hot, and mother comments on the poor garden needing attention.

Child and mother continue with flashcards, with child identifying additional shapes and objects.

Child drops the cards, and mother helps him gather them into a pile, reminding him to hold them tight.

Mother and child finish the card activity and transition to sensory play with beans.

Mother gets beads (actually beans), a strainer, bowls, and dishes for child to use for water play.

Mother demonstrates putting beans into a bowl and scooping them with a spoon.

Child begins to throw beans around, and mother redirects him to put them gently in the bowl instead.

Mother and child discuss different colored beans—white beans, black beans, green beans, yellow beans, and red beans.

Mother asks child to choose between big or small beans, offering different sizes.

Child requests specific colored beans, and mother provides them one at a time.

Mother encourages child to say "please" and "thank you" when asking for beans.

Father arrives and asks child what he's doing, and child excitedly says "beans!"

Father joins the activity, asking child to count the beans.

Mother reminds child not to throw the beans and to pour them into the bowl carefully.

Child continues requesting beans of specific colors, and mother accommodates each request.

Mother becomes concerned about the mess as beans spill around the chair and table.

Child pours beans from one bowl into another larger bowl.

Mother asks child to be more careful and not throw beans on the table, emphasizing he should put them in the bowl.

Child tries to follow mother's instructions but still spills beans while pouring.

Mother and child work together, with mother helping child scoop and pour beans into the large bowl more carefully.

Father observes and eventually helps by counting beans with child.

Mother periodically reminds child to put beans in the bowl and warns that she'll have a mess to clean.

Child helps mother gather beans from the chair and various places on the floor.

They transition to another activity, and mother asks if child would like to play with cards or get playdough.

Child requests playdough, and mother retrieves blue and another color.

Child practices the "press and pull" technique with playdough molds to create shapes like triangles, flowers, pentagons, circles, and rectangles.

Mother guides child through the motions of pressing the mold and pulling it out, making the shapes pop out.

Mother makes a variety of numbered playdough snakes and shapes.

Child and mother count the playdough snakes together, reaching higher numbers.

Mother creates a six-snake, and child learns the counting sequence from one through twenty.

Mother makes an eleven after one broke, continuing the counting practice.

They count forward through the numbers, and child eventually reaches twenty with mother's help.

Mother asks child what comes after numbers, teaching sequence and patterns.

Child learns about "hard" and "soft" and how these are opposites, similar to "easy" and "difficult."

Mother explains that practicing things over and over makes them easier to do.

Child continues making playdough snakes and requesting colors for new ones.

Mother and child create a snake that's a mix of two colors to explore color blending.

Mother wraps a playdough snake into a bracelet shape, which child tries to wear.

The bracelet breaks, and the playdough spills, ending that activity.

Child's energy level rises, and mother suggests cleaning up the playdough.

Child chooses crayons instead, and mother puts the playdough away.

Mother and child begin coloring with crayons on a new activity page.

Child requests specific colors as they color together, choosing green, blue, purple, and other colors.

Session concludes with child and mother coloring together and preparing for the next activity.
