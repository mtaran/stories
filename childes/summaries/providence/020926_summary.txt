NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Alex and his mother start playing with Mr. Potato Head figurines, with his grandmother Gigi watching and his mother's friend present. Alex asks to have a toy and is told to ask his mother instead of jumping around. His mother helps him place pieces correctly on the figurines, including finding where the nose goes on a potato head character.

They assemble multiple Mr. Potato Head sets, creating different configurations with various facial features. Alex is excited about putting on shoes, eyes, and other accessories, making jokes about putting a mouth on top where it doesn't belong. His mother teaches him proper placement while maintaining playful engagement.

After finishing with Potato Head, they transition to building block towers. His mother suggests making very tall towers and Alex eagerly participates, placing blocks one on top of another. The towers get progressively taller and eventually fall down, which becomes part of the fun as Alex knocks them over intentionally.

While building, Gigi and his mother discuss logistics, with Gigi taking Alex to school the next day. They continue stacking blocks, with Alex calling out colors like purple, red, green, and yellow. Alex expresses enthusiasm by announcing "it's getting bigger" as the towers grow taller.

They then move to playing with animal figurines. Alex explores a collection that includes dinosaurs, frogs, bugs, various sea creatures, and other animals. He names them as he discovers them - identifying a velociraptor, humpback whale, alligator, jaguar, and triceratops. His mother helps him organize the animals into groups.

Next they begin playing with toy planes and helicopters. Alex's mother narrates imaginative descriptions of different aircraft - a Blackbird, stealth fighter, and super Grover in a helicopter. They make the planes fly across the room with Alex and his mother controlling different ones.

The session continues with toy vehicles including a mail truck that "goes up my leg," a police car that opens and closes, a fire engine with a ringing bell, and a ladder truck. Alex shows active interest in how the vehicles move and operate. His mother describes the various features and movements of each vehicle.

Throughout the session, Alex demonstrates curiosity about how things work and what they are, constantly asking "what's that?" and engaging in pretend play. His mother consistently responds with detailed descriptions and maintains playful interaction, while his grandmother and the other observer provide occasional commentary. The activities showcase typical toddler play with toys, exploration of object properties, and collaborative engagement between child and caregivers.

The session demonstrates Alex's developing motor skills as he manipulates various toy pieces, his expanding vocabulary as he learns names of animals and vehicles, and his growing ability to engage in sustained imaginative play. There are frequent moments of excitement and joy as activities unfold, along with manageable frustrations when towers fall or pieces don't fit as expected.
