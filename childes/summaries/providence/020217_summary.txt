NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Mother and child clear dishes and utensils from a table, with child naming items like forks and spoons while mother organizes and teaches vocabulary.

They prepare to wash a pet (Dorothy, a fish), gathering supplies and discussing the task.

Child counts while engaging in the preparation activities, practicing numbers one through nine.

Mother reads "The Wheels on the Bus" while singing and acting out lyrics, with wheels going round and round, wipers going swish swish swish, and doors opening and shutting.

They sit together looking at a cookbook or picture book where the child identifies letters (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) as mother helps locate them on pages.

Child goes through the alphabet in the book, asking "where's the" each letter, with mother pointing them out and sometimes providing letters when child struggles.

They encounter pictures of food items in the book—pigs, grapes, cheese, fork, spoon, steak, and carrot—and mother describes them.

Child becomes distracted and starts ripping pages from the book, causing mother to express concern and ask to retrieve the torn papers.

Mother redirects child to a different activity by asking if child wants playdough and a new book.

Child receives playdough and begins making shapes, asking for help from mother to create balls and numbers.

Mother rolls playdough into numbered shapes (one through ten) while child observes and sometimes participates, practicing counting.

Child makes a snowman out of playdough and accidentally knocks it down, with mother playfully narrating that the snowman broke.

They reshape and rebuild the playdough snowman, giving it eyes, a hat, and other features.

Child requests more playdough balls repeatedly, and mother makes various shapes and objects like worms and pretzels.

They count down from ten to one while examining the playdough shapes.

Mother begins making more complex playdough creations, including shapes like circles, squares, diamonds, and triangles in response to child's requests.

Mother creates a playdough pretzel and then shapes a snowman again, with child actively participating in the building process.
