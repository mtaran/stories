NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother and child begin a cooking activity, with the mother encouraging the child to get a step stool and retrieve a blue and white bowl from a cabinet drawer. They discover a prize box containing baking equipment including a baking sheet, spoon, and cookie sheet. The mother helps the child onto the step stool to access the kitchen counter and adjusts his falling pants.

The mother finds macaroni noodles in the cabinet for the child to play with and mix in the bowl. She warns him not to eat the uncooked pasta, explaining it's hard and crunchy. The child enjoys mixing and stirring the macaroni in the bowl with various utensils, including a rolling pin and large spoon. The mother describes kitchen tools including a whisk and gingerbread-shaped cookie cutter.

The grandmother arrives and joins the cooking activity, helping supervise the child's mixing and counting macaroni. The grandmother jokes that she would starve if she relied on the child to cook, and they both laugh as the child throws items on the floor. The child attempts to count while the grandmother asks him to count alongside her.

The mother and child prepare an angel food cake from a box mix, with the mother describing the process of dumping ingredients into bowls and setting a timer. She makes timer sounds to demonstrate how long to bake. The grandmother helps monitor the child and provides assistance with the cooking activities.

The mother, grandmother, and child discuss various household activities and plans. The mother mentions upcoming appointments at Montessori, phone calls that need returning, and plans for the weekend. The grandmother discusses her own appointments and activities while the child plays nearby.

Later, the child uses the bathroom and announces to the adults, with the mother praising him for telling them. The family continues with household activities including ironing supervision, where the grandmother explains the hot iron and warns the child not to touch it. The session concludes with the family playing with toy cars and blocks, with the mother and child engaged in imaginative play where Joey the doll takes a ride in various colored cars. They discuss the cars and the child's favorite colors while playing together.
