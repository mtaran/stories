NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Ethan arrives wearing a backpack that initially hurts him. His mother checks it out and he gets a bottle while she discusses visiting the bathroom with Manuela. Ethan requests more milk and a bottle while sitting on his mother's lap. The mother adjusts his pants and suggests sitting outside on this nice day. OPE agrees and helps find a chair to bring outside.

Ethan shows interest in trains and toys with an interactive toy that opens and closes. He explores discovering holes and identifies Dinky Winky inside. His mother offers apples and Ethan eats hungrily though the large pieces hurt his teeth. She offers cookies and milk for relief, and they discuss trees blowing in the wind.

They count together and recite nursery rhymes including "Snip Snap Snoo" and "One Potato Two Potato." Ethan enjoys a Pooh story and eating cookies shaped like Big Bird, chickens, and roosters while making animal sounds.

The mother encourages Ethan to play with toy animals and a dollhouse. He arranges pigs, birds, and cows in different configurations while discussing concepts like "big" and "little," "too big," and fitting items inside. The animals eat Kix cereal while Ethan makes animal sounds like "moo cow" and "giddy up."

Ethan reads a book about Maisy with his mother, counting items and identifying ladybugs, flowers, pencils, fish, steps, ducks, leaves, an elephant, and a butterfly. They discuss colors and continue with stories about Maisy's activities. Ethan becomes interested in toys and engages in imaginative play with cars going downhill through tunnels.

His mother introduces a toy elephant who walks and wants cereal. When the elephant gets stuck trying to enter the dollhouse, they work together to free it and Ethan offers comforting gestures. They continue playing with toy vehicles racing down hills and discuss the concepts of uphill and downhill.

The mother reads "Thomas the Tank Engine" to Ethan while he enjoys snacks. They discuss the engines' colors and activities. The session ends with Ethan at a window looking outside at the nice day before the door is closed because it gets cold.
