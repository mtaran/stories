NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Alex was learning to ride a tricycle with his mother's guidance and support.

The mother told Alex to put his feet on the pedals and push them to make the tricycle move.

She gave him multiple instructions: "push," "peddle," "steer," teaching him the different actions needed to ride.

Alex said "oh no" several times, showing he was nervous or uncertain about riding the tricycle.

The mother offered to help but also encouraged Alex to try it himself, saying "I'm not doing it, go ahead."

She reminded him to watch his head and be careful while learning to ride.

An operator (OPE) was present, possibly supervising or recording the session.

The grandmother asked if Alex was hungry and if he wanted to have lunch.

After the tricycle activity, the mother invited Alex to come eat lunch.

The mother set up a step stool for Alex so he could help her prepare food in the kitchen.

Alex expressed his preference for grilled cheese, telling his mother "grilled cheese."

The mother confirmed they would make a grilled cheese sandwich and also have peaches to eat.

Alex mentioned wanting milk to go with the meal.

The mother offered Alex different fruit options: peaches or a banana, letting him choose.

They discussed what fruit Alex would like, giving him agency in his meal selection.

The mother lowered the heat on the stove while cooking, teaching safe kitchen practices.

Alex wanted another piece of cheese on his grilled cheese sandwich, and the mother gave it to him.

A fork was shown to Alex and identified for him as they prepared to eat.

The mother asked Alex how the food tasted, checking if he was enjoying his lunch.

They continued the lunch activity with mother and child interacting warmly around the meal preparation and eating.

The grandmother remained present and involved during the lunch preparation and mealtime.

The father was also present during the session, supporting the family activities.

Alex was learning kitchen safety, food preferences, and table skills during this mealtime activity.

The mother modeled healthy eating behaviors and responded to Alex's requests reasonably.

The session included multiple caregiveers (mother, father, grandmother) supporting Alex's learning and development.

The transition from active play (tricycle) to quiet mealtime showed good activity sequencing for a young child.

Throughout the session, the family worked together to ensure Alex had adequate nutrition and practice with new skills.

The grilled cheese and peaches lunch represented a balanced meal with protein and fruit.

Alex's requests were taken seriously, and his preferences were considered in meal planning.

The mother used the lunch preparation as a teaching opportunity for kitchen skills and vocabulary.
