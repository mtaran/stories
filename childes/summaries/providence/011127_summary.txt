NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Alexander (Alex) crushed his cracker while eating, creating crumbs that scattered on the floor and his shirt.

The mother told Alex she needed to change his shirt because it was dirty from the crushed cracker crumbs.

The grandmother (Gigi) reassured Alex that his mother would get him a clean shirt while they continued eating.

While the mother went upstairs to fetch a clean shirt, the grandmother cared for Alex and helped him eat.

The grandmother offered Alex juice and asked him to say please, teaching him manners.

The grandmother showed Alex a ladybug and asked him questions about what he saw.

Alex said "hi Gigi" when his grandmother looked for items they needed, and she responded warmly, "hi baby boy."

The mother suggested that maybe by the time Alex was eighteen, they could finally eat the apple she was preparing because of all the delays.

The mother and grandmother worked together to cut a pink apple variety that came from the east side market.

The mother had to find a sharper knife because the first knife "doesn't cut water," as she complained to Gigi.

Alex repeatedly said "apple" and "apple apple" in excitement as he waited for the fruit to be cut.

The grandmother picked up an apple peel from the floor after Alex had thrown it, asking what he was doing to her floor.

The mother repeated the word "peel" to help Alex learn the vocabulary for the apple skin they were removing.

Alex ate apple slices one and two, and the mother praised him, saying "you are such a good boy."

The grandmother had to find her special sharp knife from where she had put it in a safe place and forgotten it.

As Alex ate the apple pieces, some crumbs brushed off onto his clothes, and the mother said they would "brush it off."

The mother and grandmother prepared to change Alex into his clean shirt and continue with other activities.

After the apple eating, they transitioned to offering other food options including macaroni and soup.

Alex expressed his wants by saying specific words he had learned, and the mother and grandmother responded to his food preferences.

The family worked together on teaching Alex table manners, wiping his hands, and using appropriate language during mealtime.

Throughout the session, the grandmother (Gigi/Manuela) was actively involved in caring for Alex alongside his mother.

The adults praised Alex's eating and behavior, reinforcing positive actions.

The session demonstrated typical family meal-time interactions with focus on food, manners, vocabulary building, and care routines.

Alex's parents worked together to manage feeding, clothing changes, and teaching appropriate behavior during everyday family activities.
