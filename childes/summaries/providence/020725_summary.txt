NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Ethan and his mother pumped up a balloon together using an air pump, with the mother instructing him to keep pumping.

The mother thought there might be a hole in the balloon when it deflated quickly, but they tried again.

The pumped-up balloon looked like the sun, and the mother asked Ethan if he wanted to keep it or tie it.

The mother turned on a fan to keep them cool while they played.

They decided to tie the balloon onto the back of a toy train to see if the balloon could make the train move forward.

The balloon-powered train knocked things over and got stuck going through a narrow bridge because the balloon was too big.

They lifted the train and let it go again to try to get past the stuck point where the bridge was too narrow.

The mother explained that the bridge was too narrow and asked what the opposite of narrow is (wide).

Ethan suggested they might need a moat, and the mother said they needed a wider bridge.

They switched out the tracks and set up the train to go through different bridge configurations.

The mother referenced "The Little Engine That Could" story and had the train go through a trestle bridge.

The mother called out "Earth to Ethan" to see if he was thinking about the tracks.

They stopped playing with the balloon train and switched to making Play-Doh creations instead.

The mother asked what color Ethan wanted to make Pokey, referencing characters possibly from "Gumby and Pokey."

Ethan knocked down the mother's Play-Doh stack with a toy truck, playfully pretending the truck knocked it over.

They made sunglasses out of Play-Doh for a toy truck and played imaginative games with the objects.

Ethan wondered what was in a Play-Doh box that the toy had, and the mother speculated about its contents.

The mother asked if they were going to build Hokey or Pokey, and Ethan agreed to try building one.

Ethan wanted to squeeze the Play-Doh through the walls of a Play-Doh house structure they had made.

The mother called it his "special superduper squashing machine" as Ethan squeezed the Play-Doh between the house walls.

The mother told him to do the squashing on the mat, not on the rug, to keep things clean.

The mother noted that the squeezed Play-Doh looked like a big tongue, but then said it could be a wing for a plane.

They decided to make an airplane instead of the usual trains, and Ethan helped determine where the wings should go.

The airplane was "flying" as they built it, and the mother asked if it needed wheels to land.

Ethan put wheels on one side of the plane, and the mother explained that wheels usually go on the side differently.

They added a face on top of the plane and discussed where the tail should go.

Ethan wanted to put wheels on the plane, and the mother noted it already had a hole in it for wheels.

The mother made a radio announcement saying "Buzz One to ranger station, Buzz One, coming down for a landing."

Ethan realized they had made a sea plane since it had wheels instead of pontoons.

The mother added pontoons (floats) to make it a proper sea plane that could land on water.

They made a lake on the cardboard and imagined the sea plane landing on it.

The mother asked what kind of truck cleans ice, and Ethan correctly answered "Zamboni."

They imagined the airplane ice skating and doing fancy tricks on ice with wheels like ice skates.

The mother playfully suggested the airplane could have wheels between its toes like a monkey.

They added a face to the sea plane and made its eyes green and nose pink.

Ethan wanted to add wings and pontoons to complete the airplane construction.

The mother asked what would happen if there were no wheels for people to go anywhere.

The mother said she was thirsty and needed to get something to drink.

Ethan found two red fuel cars to play with, and they discussed whether to open one or two.

The mother explained these were car containers for the fuel cars.

They discovered a piece of tape and used it to connect two containers together to make one big container.

The mother mentioned the air conditioner was making a funny noise.

One of the fuel cars was "broken" because it was sticking up, and the mother referenced seeing a similar broken engine in a park.

Ethan thought maybe a truck like the "Truckbot" could help rescue the stuck car from its tough situation.

The mother used the Truckbot character to pull and help fix the stuck car, saying "he pulled and pulled."

The Truckbot successfully got the stuck car out of the tough situation and they celebrated with "hip hip hooray."

The mother mentioned the Truckbot had a good view from where it was positioned and was watching the Little Engine That Could.

Ethan's head appeared to grow in the camera view, and the mother pretended it was growing bigger and bigger.

The mother made funny faces and played peek-a-boo type games with the camera, making her head appear small then big.

Ethan played along with the "kisser" character that kept trying to kiss the mother.

The mother pretended to be upset by the kisser and asked Ethan to make her feel better.

They played with perspective looking at each other through the camera, with heads appearing small or big.

The mother suggested they might want to blow up another balloon with the air pump.

They discovered the first balloon was still attached to the train and couldn't blow it up more.

The Little Engine That Could story played out with the train getting stuck in a tunnel and being rescued by pushing it out.

The mother narrated "push Little Engine push" as they acted out the rescue.

The mother declared "the Little Engine saved the day" when they got the train through the tunnel.

The mother and Ethan pretended the mother was being pumped up like a balloon, getting bigger and smaller.

They suggested reading a story and the mother asked if Ethan wanted to read "Honey Bunny Funny Bunny."

The mother read the entire story of Honey Bunny Funny Bunny, about a brother (P.J.) who teases his sister.

The story included P.J. playing tricks like pulling covers off, pouring orange juice on cornflakes, tying knots in dresses, and mixing paint colors.

When mixing yellow and blue paint, Ethan correctly identified that it makes green.

P.J. even switched the heads on Honey Bunny's dolls, creating silly mixed animals like a bear-hen and duck-dog.

The punishment came when P.J. painted Honey Bunny's face bright green while she slept, and their parents were very angry.

After P.J. stopped teasing, Honey Bunny missed him and felt something was wrong.

P.J. showed his love by painting her face blue with yellow polka dots, which made Honey Bunny very happy.

Honey Bunny gave P.J. "a great big fuzzy bunny hug" at the end of the story.

The mother noted it had been raining outside before but the sun came back out.

The mother explained why she had to turn on the air conditioner because it was hot.

Ethan asked if they could make the sky dark, and the mother suggested closing the bedroom shades so the moon could come out.
