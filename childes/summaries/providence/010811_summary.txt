NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother mentioned they had played with books, drums, and playdough that morning and were running out of activities because it was too hot to go outside.

They played with beads, selecting colors including green, blue, orange, red, and yellow.

The mother asked "where's blue?" and the child responded to color identification.

They played a fishing game where the mother counted "one, two, three" and announced "I think I've got one!" and "fishy fishy!" The child found the activity engaging though somewhat rough.

They discussed the father appearing during the session.

The mother and child interacted with various colored beads and fishing toys during this warm summer day.
