============================================================
NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Mother and grandmother are present as child begins an activity with shape-matching puzzles or toys.

Child counts holes in the puzzle pieces while trying to determine how many each shape has.

Mother guides child to turn or manipulate the puzzle pieces to fit them properly.

Grandmother corrects child when he misidentifies a person, saying it's Amanda instead of Buddy.

Grandmother and mother help child recognize and name the person Amanda.

Child identifies a rectangle shape and mother confirms it's correct.

Child searches for a diamond shape but cannot find one among the available pieces.

Mother and child discuss different shapes that are available in their activity.

Child and grandmother work together to identify colors and shapes on the puzzle pieces.

Child attempts to line up shapes while grandmother and mother observe and guide.

Child identifies a star and mentions colors like yellow.

Mother creates an arrangement of shapes on her own to demonstrate.

Child and mother count the holes in puzzle pieces, with mother saying things like "that's four, one two three four."

Grandmother asks for coffee and explains she doesn't want to get in front of the camera.

Child and mother continue working with shape-matching, identifying rectangles and triangles.

Mother explains that certain pieces go on specific holes based on the number of holes.

Child learns that shapes with two holes go on spots marked with two, three holes on spots marked with three, and so on.

Mother and child practice matching shapes to numbered positions.

Child correctly identifies circles and helps place them in the correct spots.

Child learns about ovals and distinguishes them from circles.

Mother praises child when he successfully identifies and places a shape correctly.

Child and mother push or turn pieces to fit them into the shape-matching puzzle.

Mother and child count together to determine how many holes each puzzle piece has.

Child and mother work through multiple shape-pieces, with mother guiding and child executing.

Child identifies colors like yellow, red, and green while working with the puzzle.

Mother guides child to look for the specific number of holes on each piece.

Child learns that rectangles don't fit on circle holes and must go on rectangular spots.

Mother and child practice discrimination between different shapes (circles, ovals, rectangles, triangles).

Child successfully turns pieces to fit into correct positions.

Mother provides positive feedback when child completes placements correctly.

Child and grandmother continue participating in the shape-sorting activity.

Child asks questions about what shapes and colors are as they work.

Mother teaches that "three" means the piece has three holes and must go on a three-hole spot.

Child learns matching principles through repeated practice with multiple pieces.

Mother and child work systematically through different colored pieces.

Mother explains that certain pieces won't fit because they don't match the number of holes.

Child gradually learns to look for clues (number of holes) before attempting to fit pieces.

Mother uses encouraging language like "very nice" and "very good" when child succeeds.

Child becomes more confident in identifying shapes and holes.

Mother and child continue the shape-sorting activity throughout the session.

Various family members (mother, grandmother, operator) are present during the activity.

Child practices fine motor skills by turning and pushing puzzle pieces.

Mother maintains child's engagement by celebrating successes and providing guidance when needed.

The session focuses on shape recognition, number matching, and spatial reasoning.

Child and mother work cooperatively with grandmother occasionally contributing observations.

Session concludes with child still engaged in the shape-matching puzzle activity.
