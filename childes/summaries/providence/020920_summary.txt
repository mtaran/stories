NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Ethan was playing with toy airplanes on a mat, and the mother explained that airplanes have to go fast on the runway to take off.

Ethan made airplane sound effects saying "it going real fast it take off in the air."

The airplane was "flying" and Ethan noted that it did a loop-de-loop.

The mother made propeller spinning sounds and the airplane made zoom sounds as it flew.

The mother suggested the airplane might have a friend to play with, and they found Harold the helicopter.

Ethan correctly identified that Harold was a helicopter, not an airplane.

The mother explained that one was an airplane and one was a helicopter.

The propeller on the helicopter spun around.

A plane the mother called a "red and blue plane" appeared.

The mother named another plane "Turbo" based on the "turboprop" written on it.

Ethan asked Harold if he could teach him how to do the loop-de-loop.

Harold explained that you put your nose down toward the ground, concentrate, and flip a little to do a somersault in the air.

Both Turbo and Harold did loop-de-loops together.

The mother noted that Turbo had no wings but Harold did have wings with mini propellers on the tips.

Turbo had big propellers and wheels with pontoons, so it could land on water.

Turbo landed on its own dock.

Harold was supposed to land at the airport.

The mother explained that airplanes sleep in places called "hangars."

They pretended a box was the airplanes' hangar where they could rest.

Inside the hangar, Turbo was making noise and wouldn't let Harold sleep.

The mother sang a lullaby to help the airplanes sleep.

A visitor (TO1) interrupted by saying "hello" and "hola" to the child.

The mother told him to shush because it would wake the airplane up.

The visitor mentioned that "Brasilia is the capital."

Ethan and his mother sang "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" as a lullaby for the planes.

The mother asked if Ethan was eating his turtleneck while lying down.

The mother suggested they could put an angel or giraffe to watch over the sleeping airplanes.

Ethan said they needed a giraffe because giraffes have long necks.

The mother wondered who could read them a story while they slept.

Ethan picked the Teletubbies story book to read to the airplanes.

The story was about the Teletubbies becoming tired and going to bed.

The mother read about all the Teletubbies falling asleep except Po, who was riding her scooter.

The story had pages that were out of order, which made the sequence confusing.

Tinky Winky went for a walk with her bag.

La La was supposed to be in bed according to the story.

The mother attached giraffes to the play setup to watch over the sleeping airplanes.

The giraffes had long tongues and were looking at each other.

Ethan asked what could fly between the two giraffes, and the mother said Turbo.

Turbo flew between the two giraffes using the wide space between them.

The mother mentioned they could make something else with blocks or play-dough.

Ethan chose to do finger painting.

Mr. Potato Head was part of the toy collection and Ethan discussed his different hands.

The mother mentioned Mr. Potato Head had a little scoop to hold.

They found buckets and discussed whether they moved.

The mother noted the big scoop was downstairs.

Ethan identified that something looked like the letter "d."

Ethan and his mother slid under the train table.

They found a fire truck toy with lots of fire-fighting equipment on top.

The mother identified tools including a shovel and a pick axe.

There was a twirly thing that looked like a pinwheel.

The mother mentioned they had a real pinwheel in the room that might be broken.

The mother asked if Ethan wanted to do finger painting.

They got paper ready for finger painting and someone sneezed.

Ethan joked that Mr. Potato Head sneezed, and the mother laughed.

They were going to try finger painting with the paper.

Ethan found racing car parts and they built it together.

Ethan said "that's one part" and positioned it correctly.

The mother found the racing car guy to drive the car they built.

The mother warned about bumping into the tripod with the racing car.

Ethan bumped right into the easel.

They found a board for playing with spaceship guys.

The mother put it on top of their setup.

Ethan placed craters on the planet for the spaceship game.

The mother removed Mr. Potato Head from the spaceship setup.

Ethan wanted to put aliens on the planet popping out of the craters.

The mother referenced "astronaut piggy wiggy" and aliens.

The mother helped Ethan put a spaceman's helmet on correctly.

The spaceman's spaceship was placed up in the sky.

They added fire to the scene under the spaceship.

The spaceman was floating away in space, which showed understanding of zero gravity.

The mother explained that in space there's no gravity so the spaceman floats.

They tied a string to the spaceman to keep him from floating away completely.

The string was attached to the spaceship so the spaceman could make repairs.

The mother explained that the spaceman could now "hang out in space" while attached.

The mother demonstrated "high moon jumps" which the spaceman could do.

Ethan mentioned the spaceman needed a moon mobile.

The mother said they didn't have a real moon mobile but could pretend.

When the spaceship floated in zero gravity, it bonked into a planet and needed repairs.

Multiple alien spacemen were being set up with red and blue uniforms.

The aliens had moon boots on.

When two aliens were connected, they made one "fat spaceman."

They found a tool box with screwdrivers, pliers, and an axe.

The axe was glued to the tool box and didn't work very well.

Ethan and his mother pretended to chop down a tree like lumberjacks.

The mother explained that chopping down trees made lumber and logs.

They found a log car on the train table.

The mother suggested the log would go to a sawmill.

They built a sawmill out of blocks.

They also realized they had built a fire station with a dalmatian figure in front.

The fire station had a fire truck that belonged in the set.

They found a hospital building with red crosses on it.

An ambulance was in the toy set and worked with firefighters.

The ambulance and fire truck both had sirens.

There was another ambulance inside the hospital that was a bit broken.

They worked together to get the second ambulance into the hospital.

Harold the helicopter had landed on something and broken it.

The hospital doors were broken and wouldn't open anymore.

The mother explained they might need tools to fix the hospital mechanism.

They used the axe to pry the hospital doors open.

When someone got sick, the ambulance would take them to the hospital.

The people would be put in the ambulance and driven to the hospital.

They switched to making a submarine toy together.

The submarine had a front part, a tail part, and a periscope that went up through the top.

The submarine had a little propeller on the back.

The mother explained that submarines go under water to look at fish.

The mother sang "We All Live in a Yellow Submarine" because they made a yellow submarine.

The submarine had windows where you could see inside.

The mother joked that the driver could take a nap inside the submarine.

They found a counting crab that was running out of batteries.

The mother helped Ethan count the crab's legs - it had six legs and two big pinchers.

The mother told a story about the crab making holes in the sand and burying itself.

The crab character Mudge was referenced from a story they had read.

Ethan got silly sticking his nose in holes looking for the crab.

They had a roll of paper for finger painting and hand tracing.

The mother traced Ethan's hand on the paper with a pen.

It was challenging to keep Ethan's hand still while tracing it.

They attempted to trace his full hand including all the fingers.

The mother drew extra fingers with the pen to complete the hand drawing.

They looked at a Teletubbies coloring book with action instructions like "stand on tiptoes and clap."

Ethan tried to do the actions while standing on tiptoes.

The mother helped Ethan understand the instructions in the coloring book.

At the end of the session, there was a little accident and Ethan needed to put on pants.
