NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The child and mother engaged in an extended play session with toys and learning activities.

They played with a toy farm set, arranging a house, barn, bushes, and trees, and discussed their locations.

The mother encouraged the child to identify animals and their sounds, particularly a rooster saying "cock-a-doodle-doo." They read a story about Ethan that mentioned his family members including his mommy, daddy, cat, and fish, as well as his cousins Max, Oliver, Ana, Mason, Cole, William, and Bridget.

They made a tunnel for a toy car using a snake toy, created animal habitats with a cat in a nest and a dog in a doghouse, played with bouncy toys and clowns on colored blocks, and discussed shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles on various objects.

The mother recited the "Sam I Am" rhyme about green eggs and ham, and they sang songs about wheels on buses and taxis going round and round.

Later they played with a rubber band and string, attempting to hook and untangle toy vehicles.

They read a Winnie the Pooh story about a blustery day where Piglet flew in the wind, Pooh and Piglet slid across the road, and Owl's house got tipped over.

The child frequently expressed desire for bottles and was interested in toys throughout the session.
