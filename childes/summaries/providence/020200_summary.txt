NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Alex's mother let him choose which chair to sit in, giving him agency in his seating choice.

The mother showed Alex a prize that she had saved for him from his birthday gifts.

She explained that she had kept this prize because he had received so many other presents on his birthday.

They pulled out the prize together from its packaging, with Alex asking "what's in there" and "what is it?"

The prize turned out to be a car wash toy set that came with a small car included.

Alex's mother asked him what he wanted to say when receiving the gift, prompting him to say "please" and "thank you."

She helped him pull the car out of the toy set, teaching polite language and gratitude.

The mother retrieved the instruction manual for the car wash toy so they could assemble it correctly.

She read through step one of the instructions and explained what needed to be done first.

Step two involved putting a part over a specific spot on the toy, requiring them to push it in correctly.

Alex was trying to help with the assembly but was having difficulty with the steps.

The mother asked Alex what was wrong, responding with patience to his needs during assembly.

She worked through step three, but the pieces didn't seem to fit correctly and the instructions were confusing.

The mother noted they might have to come back to step three later and move on for now.

They discovered that a yellow piece that step three required wasn't actually in the set.

After checking more carefully, they realized the yellow piece was already attached and didn't need assembly.

So they successfully completed the toy without needing to complete step three as stated in the instructions.

The mother was patient and flexible with the assembly process, adjusting expectations as needed.

Alex remained engaged throughout the assembly, asking questions and watching his mother work.

The session demonstrated problem-solving when assembly instructions didn't match the actual toy components.

The mother modeled how to read instructions, interpret them, and adapt when needed.

Alex learned that sometimes things don't go exactly as planned but problems can still be solved.

The car wash toy became the focus of play once the assembly was complete.

The interaction was positive and collaborative, with mother and child working together.

The mother praised Alex's efforts and helped him feel successful about the completed assembly.
