NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother and Alex work together to assemble what appears to be a model train set. She pulls dusty pieces from a box and asks Alex to help. She mentions this is daddy's project and they're missing some car and truck pieces that must be in Alex's room. The mother begins connecting alphabet letter pieces together: H, Q, O, A, B, D, C, G, and J pieces that fit together in specific ways.

The mother shows Alex each letter piece and helps position them correctly on the track structure. She explains that some pieces do fit and others don't, emphasizing that placement matters. Alex helps by handing pieces and attempting to assist with assembly. The mother praises his help and thanks him for specific pieces like tracking pieces and gravel pit pieces.

When Alex gets frustrated, the mother comforts him and wipes his tears. She offers him a tissue when needed. The mother continues retrieving pieces from various locations and stays patient with the assembly process. A toy occasionally speaks with lines like "right there" during the play.

The mother reads Sesame Street books to Alex including one with Bert and Ernie characters and a Piggy bank. She identifies various characters including Big Bird and reads "Sydney Shark's Seaside Shanties" featuring sea creatures. The story describes a crab walking sideways pretending to be a spy, turtles burying eggs on land, an angelfish describing itself as the prettiest creature in the sea, a walrus, and a jellyfish.

The mother reads "Rubber Duckies Don't Say Quack" discussing all the animal sounds various creatures make but rubber duckies only squeak. The animals mentioned include cows (moo), pigeons (coo), goats (bleat), birds (tweet), chicks (peep), crickets (cheep), horses (neigh), donkeys (spray), parrots (talk), hens (squawk), peacocks (shriek), children (speak), pigs (snuffle), bunnies (wuffle), roosters (crow), and elephants (blow).

The mother reads a Big Bird song book where Big Bird greets the shining sun each morning, Oscar describes eating sardines and ice cream feeling grouchy, and Zoey settles in with her friend for story time reading books. Elmo talks about his busy day and going to sleep. Elmo's friend David helps count sheep.

The mother reads an Elmo game book asking Alex to guess and find boots, balls, and umbrellas. They spell E L M O together. Alex shows some frustration and difficulty engaging, but the mother tries various books to maintain his interest.

Later, the mother tries other activities including looking at a booklet with different Sesame Street characters. Toward the end of the session, a grandmother figure (GRA) arrives. The grandmother helps try to engage Alex by asking questions about where his phone is and encouraging him to get books and balls. They work together on a project with pieces and tracks.

Alex becomes increasingly upset and frustrated. The mother and grandmother try to redirect him with different activities, offering cookies, grapes, drinks, and asking what's wrong. They suggest looking at the garden window, seeing people walking, watching birds, and listening to bird songs.

Eventually they go on the porch where the mother helps Alex blow bubbles. She sets up different bubble wands and Alex attempts to catch and pop bubbles. They try multiple wands of different colors: purple, green, orange, and fishy-shaped wands. The mother encourages Alex saying "pop them" and making bubble-popping sounds. Despite limited success due to wind, they spend time bubble-blowing and bubble-popping together.

The session concludes with the mother and Alex on the porch doing bubbles. The mother remains patient and supportive despite Alex's difficult mood throughout the session.
