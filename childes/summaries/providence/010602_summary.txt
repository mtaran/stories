NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Ethan and his mother sit at the table together to work with Play-Doh. The mother gives Ethan pieces of pink Play-Doh and asks what he will make. She demonstrates rolling the clay and making a snake. Ethan explores the Play-Doh by rolling it and working with his hands. The mother shows him how to make a circle by rolling the material round and around.

The mother suggests making a tunnel and a bridge out of Play-Doh. She demonstrates building a larger bridge structure. They make a small Play-Doh car and add wheels. The mother narrates as they push the car under the tunnel. The wheel falls off the car multiple times during play, and the mother helps reattach it. They discuss what happens when wheels fall off.

Ethan makes a ball from Play-Doh and the mother describes it as a baseball. They discuss different types of balls including tennis balls, basketballs, and footballs. The mother pretends to pitch the baseball and Ethan plays along with hitting the ball and running bases. They repeat this game several times with the mother cheering "go team go" and "yellow team" encouraging Ethan's play.

The mother helps Ethan make a house from Play-Doh by explaining that a house is made from a square and a triangle. Ethan makes small pancakes from the clay and tears the Play-Doh apart. The mother watches him create and shape the material.

The father arrives and asks for cooking instructions about vegetables. The mother directs him to use broccoli and zucchini from the refrigerator for stir-fry. The father mentions needing to leave at four o'clock. Ethan watches his father prepare to leave.

The mother continues Play-Doh activities with Ethan, making additional items. They read a Barney book discussing cleaning up and imagination. A toy speaking Barney says "ay ya yay" when activated. The mother emphasizes keeping the microphone on Ethan's backpack as instructed.

The mother reads books with Ethan and discusses family members and feelings. They read about grandmas, granddads, mommy, daddy, and puppies who all love a baby. The mother relates it to her loving Ethan and Ethan's daddy loving him.

Ethan and the mother play with a truck and Play-Doh materials. The mother narrates "up up up and dump it" as Ethan lifts and dumps Play-Doh. They repeat this action multiple times. The mother explains the truck lifts like a crane lifts things in the air.

The mother shows Ethan blocks and alphabet letters. They identify letter blocks: N for Ethan, X Y Z, A B C D. The mother explains a letter climbs a coconut tree. They find E for Ethan and V letters. The mother helps Ethan push blocks upright and stack letters.

Ethan and the mother arrange blocks into towers and buildings. The mother helps him turn blocks and place them in holes. They build a tower structure that becomes taller. Ethan enjoys stacking and arranging the blocks.

Near the end, the mother shows Ethan alphabet-related blocks and letters. They identify snake S, other letter formations, and put blocks together in buildings. The mother praises Ethan's building efforts and accomplishments.

The mother reads a "Big Red Barn" story about animals including a pink pig, horses, an old black cat, tiger tomcat, a big red dog, and other farm animals who all live together and play in grass and hay. The story describes a scarecrow, moon, and night sky. They discuss various animals and their sounds throughout the story.

The session concludes with continued Play-Doh manipulation and exploration. The mother keeps the microphone positioned on Ethan's shirt for proper recording and manages his frustrations when he wants to remove it.
