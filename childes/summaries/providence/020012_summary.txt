NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Alex's mother suggested they would play in the snow later after eating cereal and possibly taking a nap.

The mother opened a new box of cereal for Alex to play with, replacing the old one that had too many crumbs.

Alex wanted to explore what was inside a special puzzle or game with seasonal items inside.

The mother and Alex looked at pieces shaped like Christmas themes: a star, a Christmas tree, a bear, and other holiday figures.

Alex was interested in opening the package, and his mother asked him to say "please" to practice good manners.

The mother gave Alex a gingerbread man piece to use in the game, which Alex examined curiously.

They sorted the pieces by color, trying to find a red piece and then a purple piece as the game required.

A snowman piece in the game was green colored, which they discussed and identified together.

The mother found a reindeer piece that would work for what the game needed at that point.

They continued arranging pieces according to the game's requirements, mentioning a tree and a dinosaur piece.

The mother and Alex worked through the game or puzzle systematically, finding where different colored pieces belonged.

The session included the grandmother (GRA) and father (FAT) who participated in the family activity.

The family discussed various Christmas and winter-themed pieces in the game they were playing together.

Alex's father was present and involved in directing the game play and helping with decisions.

The grandmother asked questions and helped guide which pieces should be used next.

Throughout the session, the adults encouraged Alex to participate in decision-making and piece selection.

The family worked as a team to complete the winter-themed puzzle or board game.

Snow play was mentioned as a planned future activity for after rest time.

The session demonstrated cooperative family game-playing with seasonal/holiday themes.

Alex was learning colors, following game rules, and practicing social skills like saying "please."

The family interaction was warm and supportive, with all three caregivers (mother, father, grandmother) engaged.
