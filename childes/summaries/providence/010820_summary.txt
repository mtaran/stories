NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother read a story about animals in a bathtub including a bull, cat, rat, and bug, with the fish named Chubb insisting there was room for everyone, saying "there's room in the tub for all of us." The animals splished and splashed in the water.

The mother then read a story about Bear who saw a rainbow, thinking the sky was on fire, and his friend Little Bird suggesting they search for a pot of gold.

Bear picked up an empty honey pot and ran outside toward the rainbow.

The child identified a turtle in the book.

Bear ran and climbed a hill, threw water at the rainbow, and the rainbow faded away.

Little Bird found golden honey which Bear filled his pot with and took home.

That night Little Bird came over and Bear made honeycakes, and they went on a boat ride.

Bear insisted it was "sky fire" that he put out, while Little Bird insisted it was a rainbow and she found the pot of gold.

The mother offered the child a bottle and asked if the child wanted another bear candy.
