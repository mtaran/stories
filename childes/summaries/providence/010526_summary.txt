NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother searches for puzzle pieces from the bottom of Alex's toy box. She finds several pieces and celebrates finding them. The puzzle is about "Big and Small" showing opposites like big and small, short and tall, over and under, up and down, happy and sad, above and below, empty and full, near and far, and hello and goodbye.

Alex and the mother work on fitting puzzle pieces featuring animals including turtles, starfish, fish, octopuses, and a treasure chest. The mother praises Alex's success when he matches pieces correctly. They discuss the book "Big and Small: A Book of Opposites" and the mother reads all the opposite pairs from the puzzle cover.

The mother reads the "This Little Piggy" nursery rhyme while counting Alex's toes, describing each piggy going to market, staying home, having roast beef, having none, or crying all the way home. They repeat the rhyme multiple times as Alex enjoys the interactive toe-touching game.

The father arrives and asks for help with vegetables from the refrigerator. He mentions broccoli and zucchini need chopping. The mother directs him to get these from the refrigerator. The father engages briefly with Alex before leaving to work on cooking tasks.

Alex enjoys looking at picture books including "Elmo Jumps" describing an Elmo character jumping up and down, on trampolines, in puddles, rope skipping, hopscotch, off monkey bars, and over other characters. The mother identifies each jumping action. Alex practices looking at boots, balls, and umbrellas in an Elmo guessing game. They spell "Elmo" together with letters.

They read "Old McDonald's Farm" with animal sounds and count the animals on the farm. The mother shows Alex various farm animals including roosters, cows, horses, sheep, and ducks. They identify a school bus and put toys over it.

Alex shows signs of tiredness and frustration throughout the session. The mother tries various engagement strategies including reading different books, showing pictures, and window watching. The father enters briefly again and the mother mentions Alex is tired and acting fresh. When they look out the window, the mother points out a neighbor named Wendy mowing the lawn and a cat named Lily taking a nap in the sun outside.

The mother continues reading books about characters and adventures. They read "Ernie Follows His Nose" and other Sesame Street books. Alex becomes increasingly upset and frustrated, throwing toys and books. The mother offers various activities but Alex remains unhappy.

Near the end of the session, the mother suggests going outside but notices Alex is not feeling well. She attempts bubble play with multiple bubble wands but they don't work well due to wind. Alex and the mother pop bubbles together. The mother keeps trying different wands and techniques to create bubbles. They count objects, identify colors (purple, green, orange), and eventually Alex begins to calm slightly with the bubble activity.

The session concludes with the mother and Alex blowing bubbles on the porch, though they have limited success due to wind conditions. The mother remains patient and supportive throughout Alex's difficult day.
