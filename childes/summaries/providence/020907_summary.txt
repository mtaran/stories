NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother asked Alex which truck he wanted to use - an ambulance or fire truck.

Alex picked the fire truck to work with.

The mother said they had to switch the ambulance out and only had one truck left.

Alex created a "mixed-up truck" by combining pieces from different vehicles.

The mother said it was a very mixed up truck and she was confused about what it could do.

Alex said he didn't know what the mixed-up truck would say.

The mother suggested the mixed-up truck might make animal noises instead of normal sounds.

Alex asked if the trucks do make animal noises.

The mother said she thought they probably would make animal noises.

Alex was singing something in Spanish, possibly about an astronaut.

The mother asked if he was singing the Spanish song about the astronaut.

The mother said the video had words about an astronaut in a Spanish song.

Alex asked if he could watch the video.

The mother said they couldn't watch it right now but it had the words about the astronaut.

The mother repeated the Spanish word "espacio" which means space.

Alex heard the word and the mother confirmed "espacio" means space.

The mother said "por entre nubes" which means through the clouds.

The mother continued the astronaut song lyrics about the rocket flying through the clouds.

Alex mentioned spinners in response to the song.

The mother didn't recognize what spinners meant in the song context.

The mother sang the astronaut song from the beginning.

The lyrics included "I want to take a trip to the moon and travel in a rocket like an astronaut."

The song continued with "through the space, through the clouds, over the deep blue sea."

The song described the moon going round and round while the rocket flies.

The astronaut would see stars in space and view the beautiful earth far, far away.

Alex referenced the mixed-up truck again.

The mother asked if Alex wanted the mixed-up truck for something.

Alex wanted to wrap it up in wrapping paper.

The mother said she threw the tissue paper away but had wrapping paper available.

Alex wanted a red piece of wrapping paper.

The mother cut a piece of wrapping paper for wrapping up the truck.

They wrapped the mixed-up truck in the wrapping paper together.

Alex wanted to know if they could roll it like something or fold it differently.

The mother showed how to roll it in the wrapping paper.

Alex repeated "wrap it" and participated in the wrapping activity.

The mother said "now it's all wrapped up!"

Alex wanted to put it on top of something.

The mother continued helping wrap the truck.

The mother said "it's a special surprise birthday present!"

Alex asked what could be in the special wrapped present.

The mother said "what could it be?"

The mother revealed "hey, it's a mixed up truck! Happy birthday!"

The mother called it "what a nice present!"

Alex said it was a car instead of a truck.

The mother agreed it could be called a car or truck.

The mother called it a "police engine" based on its mixed pieces.

Alex repeated "engine" when his mother named the vehicle.

The mother said they had called it a police engine the first time too.

The mother showed Alex his collection of Teletubbies figures dressed up.

Alex got excited seeing Po (the red Teletubby).

The mother mentioned Po's scooter.

Alex wanted Po to be on the scooter.

The mother asked if Alex wanted Po in or out of the shorts.

Alex said Po should be out of the shorts.

Alex asked if he could sit on the scooter with Po.

The mother said she didn't think Po could sit on it since it was small.

They positioned Po on the scooter for play.

Alex said Po was happy because the scooter is his favorite thing.

The mother corrected "her" favorite thing since the show uses different pronouns.

They removed pieces from the scooter so Po could sit better.

Alex explored the Teletubby characters and the scooter setup.

The birthday wrapping activity was playful and engaging.

The mixed-up truck creation showed creative problem-solving.

The astronaut song provided cultural and linguistic learning in Spanish.

Alex was developing vocabulary and motor skills throughout the session.

The Teletubby characters were favorite toys that Alex enjoyed playing with.

The mother facilitated creative play with multiple toy themes.

Alex demonstrated imagination in wrapping the truck as a gift.

The session combined language development, fine motor skills, and imaginative play.

The mother supported Alex's interests and built on his ideas.
