NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother reads a story about a little girl waking up in the morning and getting musical instruments including a horn, drum, and wagon. She reads several picture books including "I Went Walking" with colored animals. Ethan identifies animals and their actions as the mother describes a black cat, brown horse, red cow, green duck, and pink pig all looking at the child.

They discuss dance movements and animal actions. The mother reads "On My Street" and Ethan identifies people and their activities including jogging, shopping with a cart, riding bikes, rollerblading, jumping rope, using laundromat services, waiting for buses, pushing strollers, mailing letters, walking dogs, and waving. They explore colors and objects in detailed observations.

The mother reads "Fred's Bed" where a little boy named Fred tries different beds including an eagle's nest, rabbit hole, frog area, monkey's lap, porpoise pod, and bat cave before finding a regular bed that's just right. Ethan enjoys the silly options and unusual sleeping arrangements.

The mother reads about a bunny named Max who loves chaos and pockets. Max puts everything in his pocket including feathers, bubbles, sand, broken eggs, ants, gum, and other treasures. Ruby keeps cleaning up Max's messes while Max keeps filling his pockets. They discuss the things Max collects: toys, dolls, robots, shoes, and various objects that Ruby organizes.

The mother reads another book and discusses eating noodles with Ethan while continuing to read about the characters and animals they see. They talk about broccoli stew and Ethan practices saying "not for you" when declining food. The mother introduces a bunny book about the "Noisy Bunny" where the bunny hears various sounds.

The bunny wakes up to birds chirping and fluttering, hears a rooster crowing from far away, hears bumble bees buzzing, and makes crunching sounds while eating leaves. The mother describes animals the bunny encounters including two more bunnies, a frog, bumble bees, a fox, and an owl. The bunny yawns, scratches, and sneezes as he goes through his morning routine.

The bunny watches the sunset and sees a fox hunting. The mother describes fireflies with lights that help bunny know it's time to go home to mommy and sleep. Ethan becomes fascinated with the fox and wants to look at it repeatedly, examining the fox's mouth and nose.

The mother reads a bedtime story about a fuzzy bear preparing for sleep with nighttime routines including brushing teeth, putting on pajamas, turning off lights, and putting books away. The session concludes with the bear going to bed and tucked in with stuffed animals, stars, and moons visible.
