NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother and child engage in a drawing and writing activity with colored pencils and paper. The mother shows the child how to press down with colored pencils to make colors visible, and they spell out his name together: A-L-E-X spells Alex. The mother introduces letters and discusses spelling, building on the child's emerging literacy skills.

They move on to identifying colors, with the mother showing the child different colored pencils. She mentions options like red, blue, and white. The child attempts to identify colors and eventually draws with various pencils as they work on a shared piece of paper.

The mother draws faces using the colored pencils, and the child makes observations about expressions. She draws a face with features including head, hair, eyes, nose, mouth, ears, eyebrows, and chin. The child comments on whether the face looks happy, sad, or angry, and the mother engages with his interpretations. The child also draws and adds elements like dots, which the mother identifies as freckles or tears.

The mother decides to write a letter to Auntie Marie, and this provides an opportunity to discuss letter writing and correspondence. The child wants to contribute but is distracted. The mother asks the child to draw something for his cousin and encourages him to make a nice drawing to send to him.

Looking through photographs together, the mother and child identify family members. She points out his cousin as a baby, his mother in photos, his grandmother (Gigi), and other relatives. The mother explains the relationships and the context of the photos, helping the child understand his family connections.

The child requests drawings of various animals and objects. He asks the mother to draw an orange, a white face, an elephant, and a dinosaur. The mother creates these drawings, though she sometimes expresses that drawing is difficult for her. The child watches and occasionally adds colors to the drawings. They discuss the animals' features like trunks on elephants and spikes on dinosaurs.

Later, they work with sticker books. The mother reads instructions about finding stickers and placing them to complete scenes. The activities involve circling items that can make music, matching shoes, and completing other sticker-based tasks. They discuss musical instruments like guitars, pianos, and drums. The child learns about what things can be eaten and activities like playing music.

The session ends with the mother praising the child's work and helping organize stickers and sticker pages. They discuss upcoming activities and the child shows enthusiasm for continuing with the sticker book activities.
