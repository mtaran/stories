NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother asked Alex to sit near her so she could help him build something, addressing him in a gentle way.

She told him to move "quick like a bunny, quick, quick" to encourage speedy movement and playfulness.

The mother expressed confusion about how something should be built, saying she was "very confused today."

The mother counted out loud - "one" - and asked Alex to come closer since she couldn't reach him where he was sitting.

Ethan (possibly another child) called out "Gigi, Gigi" asking for the grandmother.

The mother said "hooray for Alex" in celebration, and then counted "two" as they worked on their building project.

The grandmother asked what Alex was doing with the trains he was playing with.

The mother noticed Alex had gotten something on his face and asked the grandmother to help wipe it clean.

The grandmother checked on Alex and asked him what was the matter when he seemed upset.

Alex repeatedly said "no, no, Mommy" when asked if he wanted help building trains.

The mother asked Alex what honey wanted, showing affection with a term of endearment.

The grandmother seemed to be asking about helping Alex with the trains.

Alex's mother suggested they should work on building some trains as an activity.

The mother asked Alex if he wanted to build some trains, but he resisted with "no, no, Mommy."

The adults continued to encourage train building while respecting Alex's expressed reluctance.

The session demonstrated collaborative parenting with the grandmother actively supporting.

The focus on trains suggested Alex had interest in this type of toy or transportation theme.
