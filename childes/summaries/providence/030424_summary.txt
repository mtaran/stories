NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The mother and child explore a collection of dried beans and legumes together. They examine different types of beans including kidney beans, pinto beans, great northern beans, small red beans, and black-eyed peas. The mother identifies each type as the child discovers them and shows excitement about the variety of colors and shapes.

The child and mother mix the beans together in a cup, creating a sensory exploration activity. The mother encourages the child to scoop and pour gently to avoid spilling. She notes the colors and shapes of the different beans and praises his pouring technique. The child discovers that one piece is shaped like a triangle and becomes excited about different bean sizes and shapes.

The mother explains that they cannot use all the beans at once because they need to be able to put them back in the bowl with a lid later. She makes choices about how many beans to use for their activities. The child requests more beans multiple times, and the mother gently explains the constraints of their setup.

The mother suggests making bean shakers by putting beans in eggs, but the child declines. Instead, he plays with his hands in the beans, creating imaginative scenarios where his hand takes a nap in the beans. The child identifies broken beans and asks if they should be thrown away or kept, and the mother guides these decisions.

They transition to a gluing activity where the child and mother create a bean picture. The child selects kidney beans to glue to paper, and the mother demonstrates the technique of applying glue and pressing the bean to the paper to stick. The child follows her instructions, though he sometimes picks up beans before the glue dries. The mother reminds him to let them stick and dry.

The mother tries to participate in the bean picture by asking for beans to create her own face, but the child is reluctant to share. She gently encourages sharing and eventually they work together with the mother getting two beans for her own creation. The mother makes a face while the child continues gluing his own.

The mother and child sort beans by color and size, looking for matches. The child finds pairs of beans that are the same size and color, and the mother reinforces this matching concept. They discuss which beans look like seeds and observe special features like little eyes on some beans.

The mother and child decide to glue beans to create hair for their faces. They select yellow and green beans to create different hair colors. The child and mother work together to select appropriate beans and decide on the arrangement. The activity continues with creating facial features including noses and mouths made from different colored beans.

Throughout the session, they read books together, including stories about animals and mathematical concepts. The mother and child engage in interactive reading where they take turns reading pages and discussing the stories' content and meaning.
