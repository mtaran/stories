The mother closed the door and apologized, getting ready for playtime with Ethan.

Ethan made a "doodle oop doodle oop" sound, which his mother repeated back to him playfully.

The mother and Ethan engaged in sound imitation games, making silly vocal noises together.

They read or discussed a Thomas the Tank Engine story involving the character Cranky the Crane.

The mother described how Cranky kept dropping things and couldn't seem to hold on to objects.

She explained that Cranky was being grumpy because he kept dropping items repeatedly.

But then the mother noted that Cranky didn't look grumpy in the picture - he was actually smiling.

Rusty arrived in the story, and the mother mentioned he had lots of work to do.

Rusty needed to go to the Sodor cement factory to pick up cement loads.
