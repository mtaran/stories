NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Alex and his mother heard a loud truck sound outside and went to investigate it together.

The mother helped Alex gather his sports equipment including a teeball, balls, and bats for outdoor play.

Alex got excited about the balls, repeatedly saying "balls balls" as his mother collected the sporting equipment.

The mother warned Alex not to throw a football at the camera and redirected him to throw in a safe direction.

The operator asked Alex if he wanted him to throw the football to him, and they played catch together.

The mother instructed Alex to push on the gas pedal and hold the steering wheel of a ride-on toy truck.

Alex excitedly played with various sports equipment and the mother helped him choose appropriately sized balls.

A person named Manuela from Brown arrived to join them for the session.

The mother and Alex hit balls with bats, and she encouraged him to "smash it real hard."

Alex threw a ball into the mother's garden and broke something they would need to replace.

The mother supervised Alex's sports activities and praised his efforts when he successfully shot a basketball.

A colorful ball went into a tree during play, and the children worked to retrieve it.

The mother discussed the garden and how it was growing well with tomato plants that needed stakes to hold them up.

The father (GRN) arrived home and greeted his family in the backyard.

Alex was excited to see his dad and called out "Dad!" multiple times as he approached.

The mother explained that she had only been doing regular activities with Alex for the recording session about language development.

The mother mentioned they were recording for language purposes and to just continue with normal daily activities.

The grandmother said Alex's relative cousin Jason had a baby girl.

The father mentioned he was going away next week, about Wednesday, and the mother said she was going to the beach on the twenty-third.

Alex kept asking about an ice cream truck that he heard or imagined passing by.

The father asked about Manuela and the mother explained she was from Brown University.

The mother discussed her tomato plant which had grown significantly since planting and already produced six tomatoes.

The mother showed the father a new stake for the tomato plant, explaining that bamboo stakes only hold for so long.

The father mentioned he had heavier duty plastic stakes that were more durable and cost about a dollar or so.

The father gave the mother a book and some gifts including a Precious Moments figurine and a watch.

The mother was selective about the gifts, saying she didn't want something that was too gaudy.

The watch was keeping time perfectly even though it had been in a box.

Alex broke a decorative figurine from the Christmas Tree Shop that the mother had picked out because it reminded her of Alex.

The operator kindly retrieved the ball that Alex threw over the fence into the neighbor's yard.

The mother appreciated Manuela's helpfulness, calling her "such a doll" and "so sweet."

The mother gave the father some photographs and was planning to go to the mall shopping with someone named Debbie.

The father asked if he could get some tomatoes from the mother's garden, and she said she wanted to bring the plant over to him.

The father gave the mother money to buy something for herself.

The mother discussed going to Roger Williams Zoo where they had a membership with Betsy and her children.

The father asked if they had a sticker for the zoo membership, and the mother corrected him saying it was a card called "zoo land."

The mother walked the father out and they discussed the upcoming library renovation.

The mother complimented the father's shoes and he offered to get her a pair, but she declined.

The father had to leave and asked if Alex wanted to walk him out.

They continued their conversation about plans and the mother expressed excitement about visiting the new library when it's done.

Alex begged to go swimming in the pool, but the mother said it was too cold for that.

The mother suggested hitting some balls instead and they went back to playing sports.

Alex mentioned his playhouse Disney song and the mother had him try to tell a joke to Manuela about a bear.

The mother and father discussed various topics including a new baby cousin and travel plans.

Alex's drooling was mentioned and the mother attributed it to his back teeth (molars) coming in.

The father complimented Alex's cute shoes and asked if the mother wanted him to get her a pair.

The mother supervised Alex on the swing set, pushing him and encouraging him.

The mother taught Alex to say "upside down" as two words correctly while swinging.

Alex wanted to keep swinging higher and higher in the sky, and the mother encouraged this play.

The mother worked to push the swing to get Alex going higher and faster.

Alex asked the mother to get in a swing and push him, and the mother explained she needed to push to make him go.

The mother helped Alex clean off outdoor equipment before using it.

The mother suggested getting a new big blue ball to replace the one that lost its air.

Alex asked to go swimming in the pool but the mother said it was too cold.

The mother took Alex to the garden to pick vegetables in a basket.

They picked squash, cucumbers, basil, and tomatoes from the garden together.

The mother encouraged Alex to be careful with the fragile basil and not eat it raw.

The mother explained that the peppers weren't ready yet and the zucchini was too small to pick.

Alex had to carry the bucket with both hands because it was heavy with all the vegetables.

The mother added more basil to the bucket when Alex asked for more.

The operator noted the beautiful cherry tomatoes in the harvest.

The mother helped Alex properly handle and arrange the vegetables in the container.

Alex got tired from carrying the heavy bucket of vegetables they had picked.
