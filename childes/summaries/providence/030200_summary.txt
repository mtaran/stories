NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The session focuses on Alex and his mother exploring a new Play-Doh barber shop set with multiple accessories and figurines. Alex is excited about his new Play-Doh colors: blue, white, yellow, orange, and purple. The mother shows enthusiasm, describing it as "a beautiful Play-Doh set" and "so lovely."

The mother and Alex begin by removing extensive packaging tape from the set. The mother peels and removes tape while teaching Alex about the process, including teaching the word "peel." They work together to unwrap the Play-Doh figures and accessories. Gigi (grandmother) watches and comments on how many pieces are included.

As they explore the contents, the mother identifies various barber shop tools and accessories: a blue comb, scissors (described as "a little stuck"), yellow and red items, an orange marker, a razor (for shaving and pretend shaving), electric razors, the barber chair (large and important piece), additional chairs, and various styling tools.

The mother discovers a "shape stick" that creates different shapes when pressed - the mother notes Alex can identify "a triangle and a pentagon and a square and a circle." The set also includes a roller with removable pieces that the mother warns Alex to handle carefully because "these things come off."

When an adult visitor arrives with a dog, there's excitement and greetings. The visitor mentions the dog (Maisy) and briefly engages with Alex before focus returns to the Play-Doh activity. The mother asks Alex if he wants to "do the hair" on the figures, which becomes the main activity.

The mother guides Alex through selecting which figure to style first: the little boy or the little girl. Alex chooses purple and the mother asks if he wants just purple or if he'd like two colors. They discuss color combinations, with Alex initially wanting pink, then changing to blue, with the mother suggesting he can have two colors.

The mother demonstrates the hair-making technique: placing colored Play-Doh into the hair holes of the figure and squeezing it through to create hair. She narrates the process: "I'm gonna show you watch. I'm gonna help you." She shows Alex how to grip the Play-Doh pieces and move them through the opening.

Alex becomes engaged in styling the figures with different hair colors. They explore combinations like purple and blue, green, yellow, orange, and brown. The mother manages Alex's choices when he wants three or more colors, gently suggesting he "pick two" because "if you pick three it gets to be a lot."

As Alex works on the hair, his mother provides ongoing commentary: "how about green on this colors," "this is good," and "look at that hairstyle." When Alex creates elaborate hair arrangements, the mother celebrates: "yeah look at that hairstyling," "very nice," and "excellent."

Gigi leaves the session partway through, saying goodbye to Alex and mentioning Stella needs to go home. The mother redirects Alex's attention back to the Play-Doh activity when he gets distracted.

Later, Alex begins creating hair on a new figure. He creates a "big hairdo holy moly" that the mother finds amusing but notes interferes with seeing the figure. They work through the hair-making process again with Alex gradually understanding how to control the amount and placement.

The mother demonstrates techniques: "let me show you will you let me show you please? Put your fingers in the like this the circles now do it open close open close." Alex practices opening and closing his fingers to manage the Play-Doh.

When the visitor (Claire) returns toward the end, Alex shows her his creations. The mother asks if Alex wants to "shave" the figure (using the Play-Doh razor), and discusses upcoming plans: "you're gonna have your hair styled Friday." The mother suggests Alex might want to get his own hair styled Friday as well.

Alex works on styling the girl figure as well, with the mother asking about color combinations. She suggests limiting colors and guides him toward specific choices like "orange and green" or "orange and yellow." They discuss putting the Play-Doh head back together in a new style.

The mother references a children's song (Jingle Bells) that Alex sings at one point. Throughout, Alex demonstrates growing competence with the motor task, shows sustained interest in styling the figures, makes color choices, and engages cooperatively with his mother's guidance.

Near the end, they select another girl figure and discuss what colors to use for her hair. The mother says "well how about just pick two, just pick two colors." Alex suggests green, yellow, purple, white, and other combinations, with the mother gently narrowing his choices to two complementary colors.

The session showcases extended cooperative play between Alex and his mother around a complex toy with multiple components. The mother demonstrates patience, clear instruction, celebration of Alex's efforts, and gentle boundary-setting about color selection. Alex demonstrates persistence, willingness to learn new motor skills, sustained engagement over an extended period, and growing ability to work with his mother toward completing creative projects.
