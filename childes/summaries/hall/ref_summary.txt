NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The session begins with playful interactions between family members. Remi's sister greets him loudly, and his brother makes teasing sounds. The sister playfully engages with Remi, encouraging him to say something, and when he says "hi," she asks him to speak louder, repeating "louder" three times until he says "hi" more enthusiastically.

His mother asks his sister Deidre about her lunch, and the brother playfully suggests he got her in the hiney. The sister talks about planning to hit someone in the hiney, and the mother warns Deidre not to go to school without her lunch, sending her to get it. The mother questions whether Remi is putting on his watch for school, asking if he wants to wear it.

The brother and sister discuss a watch top that appears to be missing. The mother intervenes about the lunch container, and Remi mentions seeing two kittens. The sister notes that the things are the same. The mother asks Remi about items he can bring to show and tell at school and how much the teacher said he could bring. Remi counts items and mentions a face cloth.

Remi decides to bring something to school for show and tell, choosing a specific item from available options. He counts out items and discusses what he'll bring. The session transitions to a classroom show and tell event where children gather to present items to each other and the teacher.

During show and tell, Remi stands in front of the group and presents a stuffed dog toy that he got last Christmas. The teacher asks questions about the dog, including what kind of dog it is and what color it is. Other children contribute answers, noting the dog is orange and green, and another child mentions orange and white. The teacher confirms there is green in the toy.

Remi explains that the dog's name is Donald, and the teacher remarks that it's a fancy name for a boy dog. The teacher also shows the class a small hand-cranked sewing machine that Remi brought. She demonstrates how it works, explaining that thread goes on the spool and through the needle to make stitches. The teacher comments that she's seen the sewing machines advertised but never saw one actually work before.

Remi describes using the sewing machine and mentions making a pocketbook at home. The teacher encourages him to bring the pocketbook to school next time to show how he made it. She demonstrates the sewing machine's speed, marveling at how fast the needle moves. The children watch with interest as the teacher works the toy sewing machine.

The teacher thanks Remi for sharing and transitions to asking other children what they received for Christmas. Several children report receiving various gifts, and another child, Mioki, comes up to share something brought from home, holding an airplane.
