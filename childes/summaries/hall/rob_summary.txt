NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Robbie arrives home from school and wants to eat a couple more bites. His mother notes that he didn't finish his food or juice, and his father emphasizes that she prepared the juice for him to drink. Robbie wears earphones that the pirate character wears, and his father explains that the investigator Graeme wants to hear if the equipment is working properly. The father warns Robbie not to play with the equipment, and the investigator mentions it's warm and humid.

The father scolds Robbie for crying and suggests he look or ask first instead. Robbie is distracted by the cat, which he introduces to the investigator. He proudly identifies the cat as Junior Cat and explains that people haven't seen this cat before because it's never been shown to them. The father notes that Robbie probably doesn't understand the word "senior" and wouldn't get a senior cat joke.

Robbie continues playing with Junior Cat, asking his father to pick him up so he can reach the cat on a high shelf. His father explains that this is Junior's place to get away from Robbie and almost everybody else, but daddy is tall enough to access that space. Robbie pleads with his father to pick him up to reach Junior, but his father redirects him to finish eating his cookie.

The mother prepares to visit her mother in the hospital and asks about taking the car. She plans to drop Robbie off before going to see his grandmother. Robbie expresses affection for Junior Cat and negotiates with his father about picking him up. His father insists that Robbie finish his cookie and then wash his hands and face.

At the sink, Robbie struggles with the water temperature, trying to get warm water. His mother helps him wash his hands, checking if they're clean and directing him to run them under water again. Throughout the scene, casual family banter continues about his hands, the water, and preparing to leave the house.

Later, the mother and Robbie have an extended conversation about an aquarium trip. Robbie describes various sea creatures they saw, including crabs and starfish. He explains that crabs are like lobsters but might have different numbers of tentacles. He notes that crabs have teeth inside their mouths and will bite if someone puts a finger in. He references lobsters and discusses an encounter with turtles at the aquarium.

Robbie recounts how the class went on a school bus to the aquarium and picked up a starfish from dirty water where crabs were also present. He initially estimates the starfish had sixteen or seventeen feet but his mother corrects him, explaining that creatures typically have an even number of legs to walk easily. Robbie counts out the number: "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..." eventually agreeing on eight legs.

The mother explains that when lobsters and crabs are taken out of water where they normally live, they die. She notes that people use them in cooking. Robbie saw a real lobster in a store, not a toy, similar to what he's seen on television. The mother offers to take him to Essex Street market to find one. Robbie speculates that if someone picks up a dead lobster, it won't hurt because it's already dead, suggesting somebody killed it with a gun or something.

Robbie tells his mother about the classroom field trip where students held hands in pairs. He held Steven's hand, but Steven eventually let go. Robbie reveals that Steven pushed him during the outing, so Robbie pushed back and snuck up on Steven to hit him on the backside. Steven cried from this, and in retaliation, he bit Robbie. Robbie kicked him backward, and the mother calls this behavior terrible.

Robbie's account becomes more fantastical when he claims that he rolled Steven into the street and every car ran over him. His mother gently corrects him, explaining that if cars ran over Steven, he would be dead, but Steven is quite alive this afternoon. Robbie confirms that Steven is alive every day, and his mother laughs at his literal interpretation. Robbie then shifts to talking about the lobster being alive last year.
