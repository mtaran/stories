NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Michael prepares to leave for an outing with the investigator, and his mother arranges a pickup time. She typically picks him up between quarter to four and four o'clock, so they agree to meet at four. His mother usually has dinner ready by quarter to five when his father gets home, timing the meal by hand signals on the clock.

The investigator asks about dinner times and other scheduling details. Michael demonstrates some confusion about when to follow the clock's hands versus other timing methods. His mother locks the front door, and the investigator helps Michael work through the locking mechanism, which Michael seems to struggle with. They say goodbye, and the investigator thanks the mother for her time.

Once outside with the investigator, Michael discusses playing football in the hallway. The investigator sits Michael down and asks what he wants him to say, prompting Michael to request a greeting. When the investigator says "hello," Michael asks him to say "I'm fine" instead, and the investigator complies without yelling unnecessarily.

At school, Michael participates in an extensive block-building activity with other children. They construct structures, discuss how to prevent them from falling down, and negotiate over toy blocks and trucks. Michael and other children work together building a garage structure, managing shared resources and taking turns with different pieces.

Michael and another child engage in a prolonged back-and-forth about catching and missing an object they're tossing. They play a game where Michael throws the object, the investigator attempts to catch it, and they debate repeatedly about who missed and who caught it successfully. Michael insists he didn't miss while the investigator claims he did, creating friendly competition.

The investigator eventually tires and suggests waiting about ten minutes before continuing to play football outside. They discuss Frankenstein, and Michael asks if the investigator is ready to play. Before heading out, the investigator removes Michael's wireless recording equipment, instructing him to keep his shirt on because they're still recording.

Michael and the investigator discuss the colors of their skates or racing skates. Michael insists his is green while the investigator claims his is red, then they switch positions on the colors. Near the end of the session, the investigator has lost his pen microphone and searches for it, while Michael teases him about being in trouble, follows him around giving hugs, and asks if the investigator will pick him up and take him to school the next day.
