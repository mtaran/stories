NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

An investigator named Carl arrived at Bobby's home on the morning of February 13, 1975, to record the child's daily activities as part of a language study.

The father instructed Bobby to be still while the investigator explained he was recording vital information for documentation purposes.

Bobby announced his own name was "Makey" rather than the name the investigator initially used.

The father praised Bobby for learning to spell his name, noting how beautiful it was.

The father mentioned that a friend had drawn a hideous anti-mother statement artwork, which the investigator asked to see.

Bobby expressed that he thought a woman named Bessie was mad, while the father confirmed she was mad at times.

Bobby declared his hatred for "beautiful Bessie," a drawing or artwork the father had brought out.

The father prevented Bobby from putting his foot in something, explaining his own was bigger but there was nothing to it except to pour in more liquid.

Bobby greeted the investigator and discussed whether one was supposed to wear a hat, offering to share his umbrella if needed.

The investigator jokingly thanked Bobby in Spanish, and Bobby offered the umbrella for the investigator to use.

Bobby instructed the investigator to take off his "dumb hat," showing playful rudeness.

The father mentioned that Bobby had show and tell on Mondays at school, noting the school had been a "trip" because the family went out of the city every summer.

The father recounted a word game from school where Bobby gave the teacher a series of words: "race," and eventually "pot," describing it as something you cook in with "that funny smelling stuff."

The father explained the teacher warned Bobby that they could never know when Principal Mister Goldberg might be around.

The investigator and Bobby discussed chap stick when the father offered some to the investigator.

The investigator declined the chap stick because he was catching a cold and didn't want to share germs.

Bobby stated that chap stick doesn't give people a cold, showing logical thinking about disease transmission.

The father remarked he had become "cold conscious" since "this monster" appeared, suggesting Bobby had been sick or brought illness into the home.

They discussed various umbrellas, with the father mentioning he had lost his and his sister's umbrella.

Bobby insisted on keeping track of umbrellas, repeating "keep track Bobby" as the father instructed.

They prepared to leave the house, with the father retrieving his gloves and apologizing for his forgetfulness.

Bobby noted that the investigator kept forgetting something when he didn't come to the house.

Bobby instructed the investigator to return the umbrella when they got outside, not downstairs.

The investigator confirmed they were on their way out as they prepared to depart.

The investigator set up the recording equipment, asking Bobby not to touch the microphone and to speak normally rather than shouting.

Bobby asked the investigator to turn on something related to his school, showing interest in the recording equipment.

The investigator was preparing an extra tape for later use, explaining it pays to be prepared.

Bobby asked the investigator to say his name and "Bobby Mackey" into the recording, which the investigator did.

The investigator jokingly called Bobby "little rock head," which made Bobby want him to repeat the phrase.

Bobby played at being a plane captain, making airplane noises and giving orders about guns and passengers.

Bobby engaged in imaginary play, deciding they were going to a "make believe airport" with himself as captain and the investigator as copilot.

Bobby demanded the investigator cut a wire (Willie), showing the imaginative and somewhat aggressive play typical of children.

Bobby asked what the investigator was doing and told him to be quiet, then demanded he call his father and get a cigarette.

The investigator mentioned washing dishes, and Bobby asked if he could watch.

The investigator and Bobby moved to the kitchen where Bobby watched Carl wash dishes.

Bobby asked what something was and whether Carl wanted to drink it, but Carl declined because he wasn't feeling well.

Bobby insisted he wouldn't get sick if he drank from the same cup, but Carl firmly refused.

Bobby questioned why Carl had to wash dishes, and Carl explained he was helping Bobby's dad.

Bobby thought that was a good idea and wanted to help wash dishes himself.

The investigator handed Bobby a sponge to help with the dishwashing, though he had to supervise carefully.

Bobby complained that the soap or cleaning liquid wasn't supposed to go down the drain, and the investigator adjusted the process.

They discussed drying the cups and dishes, with Bobby arguing that cups don't need to be dried like everything else.

The investigator explained that things need to be dry to be properly cleaned and useful.

Bobby examined his reflection in a saucer, and the investigator explained he couldn't see himself clearly because of the saucer's color.

Bobby asked to dry the dishes, and the investigator encouraged him, noting the glass was going slow.

They continued the dish-washing task with Bobby becoming increasingly interested in the process.

Bobby asked if the investigator liked the tape recorder, and Carl confirmed he did, calling it a nice set.

Bobby began talking to the tape recorder itself, addressing it playfully and asking if it thought he was crazy.

Bobby told the investigator he had dreamed about him and thought Carl had gotten lost.

The investigator was surprised and pleased by this revelation of Bobby's subconscious thoughts.

Bobby asked when the tape would go fast, and the investigator explained it would speed up when they changed tapes and went to school.

Bobby wanted to bring something to school, and the investigator asked if he brought items on Thursdays.

Bobby confused days, mentioning Monday was show and tell, but the investigator clarified it was Thursday and he couldn't bring anything that day.

The investigator suggested Bobby could bring something small instead of a football, which Bobby thought was too big.

Bobby showed the investigator something he had had for a long time, indicating he wanted to take it to school.

Bobby mentioned playing football and noted he had wet items, saying he should tell his father.

Bobby recounted waking up at the edge of the bed that morning, finding his position amusing.

The investigator and Bobby discussed the terminology of "edge" versus "end" of the bed, with some playful disagreement.

The investigator discouraged Bobby from bringing the football to school, reasoning there wasn't room to play.

Bobby made an observation that the investigator must be a girl because men don't wear rings.

The investigator disputed this assumption, but Bobby insisted girls wear rings and men don't.

Bobby showed the investigator his bike, noting it went "like a train."

The investigator redirected Bobby's attention, saying they needed to think about going to school.

Bobby asked if he could see everything in his closet before leaving.

The investigator said they couldn't look now, as it was getting late for school.

Bobby expressed he wanted to go to school now and didn't want to hear music because it gave him "a hard time."

The investigator offered to help Bobby turn the music off if he knew how.

Bobby called out "yo" and "shoot," demonstrating his readiness to get ready.

The investigator began helping Bobby put on his jacket and cap for the trip to school.

Bobby corrected the investigator, saying he had a hat, not a cap.

The investigator agreed they would put the hat on after the jacket was on.

Bobby refused the hood on his jacket, and the investigator cautioned him not to touch the recording equipment.

Bobby asked why the tape wasn't in one of the reels, and the investigator explained the tape had all wound to the other side.

The investigator instructed Bobby to put something in his pocket for safekeeping.

Bobby noted he didn't have pockets, then found some in another part of his clothing.

The investigator asked Bobby to stand aside while he finished a couple of tasks quickly.

Bobby remembered he had to put his booties on before they left.

The investigator retrieved the hot booties from the radiator and began helping Bobby put them on.

Bobby complained the booties were hot, and the investigator acknowledged the temperature.

The investigator noticed Bobby's shoe was untied and knelt down to help tie it.

Bobby mentioned his foot hurt at school when he went to lunch yesterday, and the investigator was concerned.

Bobby explained he had gotten ice for his foot and felt better, so nothing serious happened.

The investigator expressed relief that nothing more serious had occurred.

Bobby put his foot in the booties, with the investigator adjusting them carefully.

Bobby made up a silly song about "hot bootie," showing his playful nature.

Bobby complained about the "doody booties" and called them stupid, expressing frustration about wearing them.

The investigator steadied Bobby's foot while he got the bootie straight.

Bobby instructed the investigator to "tie them booties up," showing he understood the need to secure them.

The investigator tied the booties properly and confirmed they were secure.

Bobby questioned why the investigator said that and seemed skeptical about the claim.

They checked the condition of both booties together.

The investigator announced it was February 13, 1975, and they were about to leave for school.

Bobby asked how the investigator was doing and whether he was going to school with him.

Bobby wanted to know if the investigator was going to teach, showing curiosity about his role.

The investigator confirmed he would accompany Bobby to school.

The investigator told Bobby to wait while he checked something quickly, and then said "I think we're in business," indicating the recording was working properly.

Bobby expressed he could walk to himself and asked if he could walk to school without help.

Bobby made up a silly song about a "bad boy" who eats bread when a "wise guy puts bread on the table."

Bobby identified his father as the "wise guy," and the investigator asked for clarification.

Bobby playfully said he was going to eat the investigator up, showing his silly mood.

The investigator told Bobby to leave his cigarette at home, not to take it to school.

Bobby referred to his fake cigarette, calling it his "phony."

The investigator needed to use the bathroom before they left and promised to return quickly.

Bobby noticed the investigator had turned on a light and mentioned he had turned it on himself.

The father appeared and complimented Bobby for turning on the light.

The investigator returned and announced they should depart for school.

They traveled to the school building, with Bobby making various observations and the investigator monitoring the sound quality.

The investigator mentioned they had to discuss the school bus situation with a professional driver.

The investigator explained that keeping up with a fast school bus driver on the road could be dangerous.

The investigator described losing radio contact if he couldn't stay close to the bus.

The father asked if Bobby was going to be on the bus.

The investigator confirmed the kids would be on the bus for the recording.

Bobby asked if the investigator was going to take him to school.

The investigator explained that Bobby didn't go to this school, which was in Valley Stream on Long Island, and that it was a creative school.

The investigator asked if the father had heard of the creative school.

The father said he hadn't but mentioned valley stream park where he had taken patients the previous year.

Bobby said nobody had been to this school before, but added that "big Kevin comes to this school," showing his focus on peers.

Bobby called out to Jonathan, showing his awareness of other children around.

The father asked if Bobby could make it up the steps, offering supportive encouragement.

Bobby's teacher Miss Meyers greeted them warmly.

The father introduced himself and the investigator, Carl Jones, to the teacher.

Miss Meyers explained they were deciding whether to stay in the current classroom or move to another.

The investigator asked about the classroom arrangement, and Miss Meyers explained they only had a few kids that day and had combined two groups.

Miss Meyers said this wasn't their usual arrangement, showing how the presence of the recording study affected the classroom dynamics.

The investigator expressed flexibility about where to record, either inside or outside the classroom.

The investigator explained he wanted to record Bobby in three situations: free play for fifteen minutes, snack time for fifteen minutes, and a directed activity.

The investigator asked the teacher to let him know when these activities would occur so he could set up properly.

Miss Meyers expressed concern that having one group of children today and a different group tomorrow might affect the study's validity.

The father interjected that this was normal since Bobby would have to adjust anyway on any normal day.

The father's point was that adjustment was part of regular school experience, not something unique to the study.

Miss Meyers acknowledged the father's logic and agreed it was normal.

The investigator assured Miss Meyers there was no problem with the varied arrangement.

The father took Bobby's boots off, helping him change into his school clothes.

Bobby and the investigator began exploring the school building together.
