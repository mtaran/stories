NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Von expresses reluctance about wearing the recording equipment for the day, concerned that it will be noticeable to others.

Von's mother reassures him that wearing the equipment won't be a big deal and that he can go about his normal daily activities without worrying.

Von doesn't want the wire showing, and his mother assures him that the wire won't be visible even if it does show.

Von's mother explains that if friends ask about the equipment, he can simply tell them it's a small recording device.

Von suggests he would tell them it's just a "play wire" to downplay the equipment.

Von's mother warns him not to let friends pull on the wire and explains that he can do everything normally with the equipment on.

Von learns that the recorder is a transmitter and discusses its placement and visibility with the investigator and his mother.

Von's mother puts a vest on top of a shirt to hide the wires and equipment, expressing excitement about the recording.

The investigator and Von's mother discuss the equipment setup and confirm that the arrangement works well to conceal the recording devices.

Von asks why FAD didn't clean it up, and FAD explains that he took Star out the previous night at ten o'clock.

The family decides to take Star for a walk to the bus station so Star can have a proper bathroom break.

The investigator confirms that he can hear Von and notes that they'll be taking Star for a walk.

Von's mother asks if the investigator can hear anything through the recording equipment, and he confirms that he can.

The investigator notes that it's a different experience from what he expected and comments on the setup.

Von doesn't hear anything initially, and the investigator explains what he can hear through the equipment.

The investigator can hear Von speaking through the recording equipment.

Von wears the headsets and listens to the investigator but doesn't speak, just standing quietly.

Von's mother encourages Von to at least tell Carl his name and what his name is.

Von appears shy or hesitant about speaking into the recording device while wearing the headsets.

The investigator comments that Von is standing with the headsets on but not saying anything and keeps his hands over his face.

Von eventually speaks and the investigator responds that Von heard himself and notes that it's "fabulous."

Von experiences hearing his own echo through the headsets and comments on hearing his voice come from one ear.

Von notes that typically you only get chicken pox one time.

Von mentions that usually after chicken pox, Julie cooks the food, though he didn't have that experience.

The mother asks about Von's gloves, and Von insists he has two gloves.

The mother suggests Von should have matching gloves, and Von wants a new matching pair.

The mother helps Von find a matching glove, but Von wants different ones he's spotted.

Von's mother mentions that one glove's mate is somewhere else on the table.

The mother notes it doesn't really matter which gloves Von wears as long as they keep his fingers warm.

Von notes that his gloves don't have a broken thumb like others that he's chewed on.

Von's mother suggests Von can wear certain gloves, but Von prefers mittens instead.

Von's mother indicates that her goal is just to keep his fingers warm with whatever he chooses.

The investigator assures Von that the equipment will still record regardless of what he wears.
