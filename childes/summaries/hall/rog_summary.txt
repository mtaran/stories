NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The investigator fits Roland with a microphone and recording equipment at the beginning of the session. The mother confirms that Roland has finished his meal and is ready to go. The investigator helps Roland put on his coat, noting that it is extremely cold outside, about sixteen degrees Fahrenheit. The mother buttoning the top of the coat, and the investigator assures her this will be acceptable.

Roland needs help with his buttons and fingers, and the mother continuously directs him, saying "come on Roland" and "let's go." The mother mentions the tapes, and there's some confusion about what needs to happen before they leave. The investigator laughs about something, and they prepare to depart for the elevator to go downstairs.

Roland cannot find his green hat, which his mother says is in the kitchen on the table. He's lost his gloves and asks his mother repeatedly where they are. The mother tells him to look for them where he put them last night and instructs him to pick his sweater up off the floor. The mother discovers he has a red glove in his pocket and retrieves his other red one. The mother is running late and tells Roland to wear those gloves for today.

The investigator works to complete the recording setup while Roland and his mother prepare. Roland asks where his coat is, and the mother provides it. The investigator tests the microphone equipment, asking how it sounds and if it sounds pretty good. Another child in the background requests keys so she can lock the door.

At school, Roland interacts with his classmates and teachers. During a classroom activity, children engage in play and learning activities. A teacher instructs children to clean up and assigns tasks. The investigator asks children about their activities and watches them work. Roland demonstrates some excitement about showing off, mentioning "pow pow" actions and enthusiastically discussing a flying kick he saw.

Roland tells the investigator his full address: "my name is Roland Green, I live two one seven five apartment two d." The investigator corrects him, saying that's not where he lives. Roland insists he moved to a different location in the projects, but the investigator tells him he did not move. Another child starts to mention moving, and the teacher redirects the classroom cleanup efforts.

During the recording session at school, there's a discussion about a picture of Joe Louis. The investigator explains that Joe Louis is a famous boxer, not Muhammad Ali's friend. The children ask what Joe Louis did, and the investigator explains he's a professional boxer with big muscles. One child claims their mother had a fight with someone named Tito and had a gun on him while Tito had a knife. The investigator expresses skepticism about whether Tito fought Joe Louis, and another child interjects that Roland's mother never bullied anybody.

The investigator holds a microphone in front of his face so children can't see him, and they play a game about whether they can see him or not. The children insist they can see the investigator, and he insists they cannot. The conversation becomes playful with repeated exchanges about visibility. Eventually, the investigator takes back the microphone and continues with the session.

Later at home, Roland asks the investigator about fixing equipment that broke. The investigator says he'll try to fix it when he goes home. There's disagreement about the light being on or off, with the brother cutting the light off and Roland wanting to keep it on. The mother intervenes, asking Roland to sit up and directing him to sit on the other side of the room while leaving the light alone.

Roland wants to draw something and asks if he can write on paper. The brother says he needs paper for writing, so the mother promises to buy him more paper. The investigator and Roland move to the kitchen where Roland will draw. Roland decides to draw a rainy day scene, initially attempting to draw a fish but then pivoting to focus on the rain. The investigator helps guide Roland's drawing, suggesting he start with a circle and make it bigger.

Roland practices drawing with assistance from the investigator, who helps him understand how to approach the sketch. Roland makes attempts at circles and other shapes, gradually working on his rainy day drawing. He mentions drawing birds and a head, worrying about getting the features right. The investigator provides pencils and pens, and they continue working on the artistic project together.
