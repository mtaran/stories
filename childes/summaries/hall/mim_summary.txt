NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Julia tells her family about her circus stories while they prepare to leave the house for school. She plans to perform as the balloon lady at the circus, a costume featuring a recording device so she won't need wiring connected to her. Her brother teases that the balloon lady floats up in the air, while her sister suggests she'll only have twelve balloons to pass out to everyone in the class.

The investigator explains the technical setup of the wireless recording equipment, describing the antenna, transmitter, receiver, and recorder components that will allow him to record her activities at school. He plans to accompany Julia on her way to school and will return her around four o'clock, with the family expecting dinner by quarter to five when the father gets home.

Before departing, Julia gets paint on her shoes from a painting project at school. Her mother prepares her for the day, braiding her hair in two braids per Julia's preference. Julia mentions wanting to wear her hair in a big bun like when she goes to church with Elizabeth, and her mother addresses her hiccups by offering her water.

The family discusses various topics over food and refreshments. The mother explains that Pero is a health food beverage made from roasted ground malted barley, rye, chicory and molasses, similar to Postum. Julia thinks the toast is burnt while her mother insists it's nicely brown. The father mentions potentially attending a conference on infectious diseases on Sunday without charge.

Julia's brother asks how far the transmission antenna can reach, and the father discusses horse racing, explaining that people bet on jockeys who ride winning horses. Julia plays a card game with her mother and sister, playing go fish and counting cards at the end, with her mother finishing last, her sister in the lead with thirteen cards, and Julia in second place with ten cards.

Late in the session, an investigator finishes his recording time and mentions getting his picture taken. Julia performs a singing act for Carl, singing a funny song about how someone wears fancy pajamas in summer, flannel nighties in winter, and jumps between sheets with nothing on at all. The session ends with a circus performance at school where children take turns performing as tight rope walkers and other acts, with Elizabeth and other classmates participating in the entertainment.
