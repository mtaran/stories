NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

At breakfast one morning, Christopher admired his tall father while eating with his family.

His mother announced they would leave for school in about twenty minutes.

Christopher wanted to go to school immediately rather than wait.

His sister Jenny asked for permission to take bacon, and the mother agreed.

The investigator, Graeme (Tom), arrived at the house, introducing himself to the family as conducting a research study.

Christopher curiously asked what the investigator's equipment did, learning he was wearing a transmitter so the receiver could pick up his voice.

The investigator explained he had an earphone container, which Christopher and Jenny found interesting.

Christopher pointed out a window at a helicopter flying by, and the family gathered to watch birds and distant objects through binoculars.

They spotted pigeons flying over the river, and Christopher was excited to see two pigeons together.

The mother cleaned the binoculars lens and helped Christopher focus them better.

Outside through the binoculars, Christopher spotted something yellow and white hanging in a tree, puzzling everyone about how it got there.

The family needed to use the bathroom before leaving; Christopher went to tell his father while Jenny tried.

Christopher asked his father about making something, receiving tools from the investigator to fix broken equipment.

The investigator needed glue to repair his broken receiver, and Christopher eagerly offered his large bottle of glue from home.

Christopher put on his sweater and jacket, asking his mother about his father's height and weight.

His mother said his father was five feet eleven and three quarter inches tall and weighed about one hundred sixty-five pounds.

Christopher was impressed that his father was a minister who knew all about God.

The investigator showed Christopher a stereo with left and right channels, explaining that adjusting the volume made sound louder and softer.

A blinking light on the equipment showed it was operating and working properly.

The mother brushed the children's hair and prepared them for school.

Christopher and his sister played with playdough, making shapes and figures.

They identified letters and objects by drawing them, with Christopher making a magnet shape and guessing games about objects.

Christopher demonstrated a gun shape, then changed it to a golf cart, then back to a gun again.

He made trumpet and tuba sounds with his mouth, then a harmonica sound, then identified a hammer by the banging sound.

As the family prepared to leave, a water pipe in the kitchen was dripping, which the father mentioned was bothering the mother.

Before departing, Christopher told the investigator goodbye, saying "see you later alligator" as Joey's daddy always says.

In the elevator heading down, Christopher counted the buttons and explained that Robby lived on the eighth floor.

Outside, they encountered Christopher's grandmother who was visiting, asking if the family was going to school.

The weather had become rainy, and the mother worried about the umbrella breaking.

Walking through the rain, Christopher spotted a truck and tried to use the binoculars to look at things.

He observed someone sneaker hanging on a tree and hoped someone would clean up the messy neighborhood.

Christopher pointed out the doctor's office where he went for checkups.

They passed a food vendor selling pretzels, and Christopher asked many questions about the street and pedestrians.

Christopher noticed people waiting to board a public school bus and wondered why they were in line.

His mother explained that the bus took up so much room that cars had to wait.

Christopher imagined what would happen if people had flying cars or helicopters instead.

He asked why helicopters don't come down, and his mother explained people need to get on and off them.

A man named Mister Norman Vincent Norman, the father of Christopher's schoolmate Kevin, passed by and greeted them.

Christopher told his mother about a time he saw a lady who got angry at a car driver for not stopping.

The lady had banged on the driver's car and told him to stop because he almost ran over them.

Christopher's mother reminded him that even with a green light, you must look both ways before crossing.

They saw a truck and bus on the street, noting how the truck avoided hitting the bus.

Christopher asked about the colors of trucks and buses he could see, mentioning black, yellow, and what he called "tangerine" colors.

The mother corrected his color perception, noting she hadn't seen yellow trucks.

Christopher was glad to get his binoculars back and continued playing with them.

They reached the schoolyard where Christopher's teacher and other children were waiting.

Children greeted Christopher, including Gabriel, Tony, Debbie, and Bernice.

The teacher asked Christopher what the binoculars were for, and he explained they were for looking far away.

The teacher questioned whether binoculars made things look far away, and another child expressed disbelief.

Christopher repeatedly asked if he could go up to the loft, which was the elevated play space.

The teacher had to explain that the loft was full and he would have to wait for someone to come down.

Christopher read name cards to see who was upstairs, identifying Matthew, Greg, Tony, Todd, and Asher.

Another child mentioned Gabriel was downstairs, not upstairs, correcting Christopher's observation.

Gabriel asked if Christopher wanted to be a daddy in the loft's pretend house, but Christopher resisted at first.

The children created a complex pretend scenario where Christopher became a daddy figure.

Christopher told Julia about the watch his grandmother gave him, which had a boy and dog running on it.

Christopher's father arrived at the loft, and Christopher reported that a kid had hit him with her toy dog and kicked him.

The investigator checked if Christopher was okay, while another child (Julia) argued that a kick hurt but a toy dog wouldn't.

The children discussed whether real dogs could bite, and Christopher imagined getting a dog that would bite the other kids.

Christopher asked where the investigator was going, and learned they would go to school together.

Christopher wanted the investigator to stay and play with him, asking if Graeme would come to his house again tomorrow.

The group went to school together, heading toward the classroom.

In the classroom, a cockroach appeared, causing chaos among the children.

Children screamed and tried to catch or kill the cockroach.

They built a trap for it using graham crackers and peanut butter, working together.

Christopher announced the cockroach was trapped, and they moved on from the excitement.

The teacher gathered interested children for a painting activity using circles for collage.

Christopher repeatedly asked to go up to the loft despite being told there wasn't room.

Christopher tried to count how many people were in the loft to prove there was room for him.

Children engaged in pretend play with the loft as a house where they were fathers and children sleeping.

Julia and Sarah had a physical altercation with Christopher, and the investigator intervened to calm the situation.

Christopher told the investigator that Julia hit him with her toy dog and kicked him.

The investigator told Julia that hitting wasn't nice, and told Sarah that kicking wasn't nice either.

Christopher and another child pretended they would get dogs to bite people who bothered them.

Christopher showed the teacher his gingerbread boy made from playdough at home using a cookie cutter mold.

The mother came to pick up Christopher, and he asked if she would take his painted gingerbread boy home.

She agreed to take it home, though it wouldn't be dry by the time he left school.

Christopher made a baseball card from his house, which impressed other children.

A child asked where Christopher got the camera, and Christopher showed them the binoculars instead.

Children played a game where they pretended the classroom was a boat, and Christopher was looking for baseball players through the binoculars.

He joked that when you look through binoculars, you see a fat head.

Children tried to sneak up to the loft without the teacher noticing.

Christopher told his mother he had gotten his binoculars back and was happy.

The children engaged in superhero imaginative play, with Christopher being different characters like Spider-Man, Batman, and Shazam.

They discussed TV shows they watched, including Scoobie Doo, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, The Electric Company, and Captain Marvel.

Christopher declared he liked Captain Marvel and described having boots, a cape, and special hair.

Christopher and another child (Todd) planned to sneak through the loft window to scare other children.

They successfully scared Debbie, who was surprised by their sudden appearance.

Children played with baseball cards and imaginary boats.

Christopher looked through the binoculars and saw other children's eyes up close.

He joked about seeing fat faces when looking through the binoculars.

The children created an elaborate pretend game where some were Space Cadets and others were dinosaurs.

They made dinosaur sounds and discussed the dinosaur as their pet.

Christopher pretended to be Kong Fuey, a martial arts character.

Children ran around the classroom playing tag and hide-and-seek in the loft space.

The teacher told Christopher and Todd that running in the classroom was dangerous due to corners and people getting hurt.

The teacher asked them to walk instead, and Christopher agreed to slow down.

During snack time with green-colored water and crackers, Tony spilled water on Christopher's head.

Christopher complained to the teacher that Tony was dropping water on him.

Children argued about who spilled water and made a mess at the snack table.

The teacher scolded the children for spilling water, saying it was for drinking, not for spilling or playing.

Tony poured water into other children's cups, causing chaos.

Christopher told the teacher that Tony had poured water into his cup.

A child poured water into Gabriel's cup, and the mess continued to escalate.

The teacher threatened to stop giving the children juice and water for snacks.

She made all the children clean up with paper towels.

Christopher complained that Graeme had pushed a table on him.

The investigator told the children not to push tables into other children because it was stupid and dangerous.

Children began using inappropriate language, including profanity, during the chaos.

One child said a bad word, and another child corrected them, saying they should behave.

The teacher scolded the children for spitting and using bad language.

Christopher and other children took turns sitting at the drawing table with the teacher.

The teacher asked Christopher to tell her about making the gingerbread boy.

Christopher explained he made it with a cookie cutter that pushed down and had an eye.

The teacher asked if it was like a cookie cutter, and Christopher confirmed.

The teacher asked Christopher about the materials used and where he made it.

Christopher said he made it at home with his mother using yellow playdough.

The teacher asked if it was like playdough, and Christopher said no, but it was yellow.

The teacher asked what store he got it from and what recipe was used.

Christopher described the ingredients: flour, salt, coloring, oil, and water.

The teacher began writing down the ingredients Christopher listed for making the gingerbread boy.

Christopher explained that flour comes in a bag and salt is another ingredient needed.

The teacher asked about coloring, and Christopher said you could use any color.

Christopher mentioned needing oil and listed it as another ingredient.

The teacher asked what container to mix ingredients in, and Christopher said a bowl.

The teacher worked with Christopher to document his recipe on paper.

Other children interrupted with various requests and complaints while the teacher was writing.

The teacher asked Christopher if milk or water went into the recipe.

Christopher said no, explaining the mixture goes in a bowl.

The teacher began creating a documentation page titled "Gingerbread Boy" with a picture and ingredients list.

Afternoon snack time continued with the children eating and drinking water.

The father (FAD) gave one child something to take home carefully.

The teacher asked about the father's flight time, and he mentioned the plane leaves at six o'clock.

Christopher told the father he had gotten his binoculars back.

The father was impressed with the watch Christopher's grandmother gave him, which had a dog and boy running on it.

The father explained how clock hands work when the big hand is on the twelve, it's o'clock.

Christopher mentioned having a record that tells time and a rabbit.

The father advised Christopher to take good care of his watch.

During a teacher-led activity, the investigator was asked to read a story to some children.

The investigator declined, saying he would read a story in a little while.

Children requested the investigator hold things, keep items, or help them with tasks.

Towards the end of the school day, Christopher's mother returned to pick him up.

The mother greeted the teacher and other parents who were picking up children.

She helped Christopher remove his jacket and get ready to go home.

Christopher carried his painted gingerbread boy that the mother was taking home.

The teacher reminded Christopher not to drop it because playdough figures break easily.

Christopher asked about different activities happening in the classroom.

At home, the investigator sat with the family for the bedtime ritual.

The mother began reading "The Cat in the Hat" by Dr. Seuss to Christopher and Jenny.

Christopher participated by guessing what the cat was holding as the story progressed.

The mother and children identified objects the cat could hold: cup, fish, umbrella, book, ball, plates, cake, hat, and books.

Christopher guessed "ship" when the mother said "boat."

The mother explained that "ship" rhymes better with "dish."
