NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

The session began with Dexter, a four-year-old boy, interacting with his family and an investigator named Carl in what appeared to be a preparation for school rather than a bedtime routine.

Dexter was curious about a strange object on his back, asking his mother about an antenna and wondering if it was like a musical box.

His mother acknowledged the object while his father, who was also present, briefly confirmed it was indeed an antenna.

The family discussed the weather, noting it was very windy and chilly outside, which meant Dexter would need to wear warm clothing.

The mother wondered aloud why they did not see Uncle Winston, who lived near Granddaddy, prompting Dexter to ask who Winston was.

Dexter was fascinated by the microphone and antenna equipment, repeatedly asking about what these devices were and how they worked.

When asked about orange juice, the mother declined and asked if Dexter wanted some before leaving for school.

Dexter admired what appeared to be a dancing bear toy or decoration, expressing delight with the word 'fantastic' repeatedly.

The father asked where the dancing bear came from, and Dexter explained that someone had given them out at school during a celebration.

Dexter mentioned a celebration at school where there were cupcakes and cookies, and he talked about people wanting to know the recipe.

When asked if the school treats were as good as his mother's baking, Dexter confidently stated that his mother's were better.

The mother was adjusting her wig and did not want the wind to blow it off, explaining her protective measures to her son.

The investigator Carl reintroduced himself to the family and inquired about a significant event in Dexter's recent past.

The mother informed Carl that Dexter had lost two teeth since the investigator last saw him, which was a notable change.

When asked what happened to cause the tooth loss, Dexter initially said he went to the dentist, but his mother corrected him.

The mother pressed Dexter to explain the actual incident that caused him to lose his teeth, suggesting it involved physical activity.

Dexter described a fight with his brother where his brother had tied his hands behind his back and thrown him into the living room.

Dexter noted that while he fell on his face and cried a bit, the impact did not hurt as much as he expected.

The mother confirmed that Dexter had fallen on his face, which knocked his teeth loose, requiring a dentist visit to have them removed.

The mother reassured Dexter that fortunately, the lost teeth were baby teeth and not his permanent teeth, though Dexter clarified only one was baby.

The mother explained that one tooth came out that night and the second came out two days later, resulting in Dexter becoming temporarily toothless.

Dexter expressed concern about further tooth loss, noting that the process of losing teeth hurt him.

The investigator asked how long it takes to walk to school, and the mother replied it was about three to four minutes since the school was located across the street.

Carl mentioned he was running low on tape and needed to change it, which would take a couple of minutes.

The mother graciously offered to wait while Carl changed his tape, ensuring the recording could continue without interruption.

Dexter mentioned hearing a story and claiming his name was Simon, though the investigator questioned this claim.

When asked why he was Simon, Dexter clarified that his actual name was not Simon, but he had heard a story about someone named Simon.

The family was watching television, with Captain Kangaroo appearing to be the program, and the father asked what would happen at school today.

Dexter responded that he did not yet know what would happen at school that day.

The father inquired if Dexter had finished building with his Lego set, and Dexter confirmed he had completed a Lego creation.

The father pointed out that the cars Dexter built resembled old-fashioned Model T Fords, the kind his grandfather once owned.

Dexter expressed skepticism about whether even the Six Million Dollar Man could lift one of those heavy cars.

The investigator asked if Dexter could pick up one of those cars, and noted that the Six Million Dollar Man was quite strong.

Dexter indicated he was a fan of the Six Million Dollar Man television program.

The father corrected Dexter by noting that the investigator was speaking to him, and Dexter had not been paying attention.

Dexter made an odd comment about silly putty being made by eggs, which the father questioned.

The father observed that jumping rope appeared to be difficult for an older person shown on television.

The investigator questioned why someone would jump with a rope behind them rather than in front where they could see it.

Dexter repeated the investigator's observation, suggesting it would be better to have the rope in front rather than behind.

The father directed attention to bicycles shown on television, noting the large front wheel design.

Dexter asked if his father had a similar bicycle with a very large front wheel when he was young.

The father explained that while he did have a big front wheel bicycle, it was not nearly as large as the one depicted.

The father recalled making a baby carriage similar to the one shown on television, demonstrating his resourcefulness from childhood.

The investigator expressed admiration for the bicycle skill demonstrated on television, noting it was something he could not easily do.

The father shared a childhood memory of removing hoops from barrels and making a wagon, which was a creative entertainment activity.

Dexter suggested that his uncle Buddy would pull the wagon, and then Dexter could pretend to be Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.

The father confirmed this memory, stating that his brother would push or pull him in the wagon.

The investigator and father discussed the price of a contact lens at a nearby store, with Carl mentioning he paid a dollar ninety-five elsewhere.

The father noted that stores near Columbia University tended to stay open late to serve student customers but charged slightly higher prices.

Dexter had a floppy hat that the father suggested he should not wear until it was time to leave for school.

Dexter insisted it was time to go, but the father disagreed, saying they had not yet reached the departure time.

The mother asked if the father had opened a window to air out the house, and he confirmed he was doing so before they left.

The father told Dexter to close the window, but Dexter wanted to keep it open to observe what was happening outside.

The mother instructed Dexter to get his coat, hat, scarf, and gather his school bag, removing anything left over from the previous day.

Dexter said he was taking everything he had brought the day before, meaning all his items.

The investigator asked what Dexter had taken to school yesterday and whether he was supposed to take toys to school.

Dexter clarified that he was not taking all his cards but was looking for a very special card he wanted to bring.

When asked why the card was special, Dexter explained it was featured on a television show he loved.

Dexter expressed frustration that the show had been taken off the air, saying he hated that it was no longer on television.

The investigator helped Dexter by pinning a microphone or recording device on his clothing so they would not have any technical problems.

After being pinned with the device, Dexter enthusiastically jumped up and tried to throw a ball into a basket indoors.

The investigator questioned whether Dexter was trying to emulate Wilt Chamberlain, the famous basketball player.

Dexter proudly mentioned that he had gone to see the Harlem Globetrotters, a famous exhibition basketball team.

When Dexter missed the basket, the investigator noted that the shot was too easy and made a different suggestion for making it harder.

Dexter asked if he could make the game even more difficult, showing his competitive spirit and desire for a challenge.

The father warned Dexter that he was making the task very easy and expressed concern that Dexter might break the toy with his play.

When the ball rolled under furniture, Dexter searched for it and eventually found his ball.

The mother called Dexter by his nickname and informed him she was sending Vaseline with him in case he had nosebleeds again.

The mother explained that she would label the Vaseline with Dexter's name so teachers could use it if needed in his afternoon class.

Dexter expressed reluctance about needing to bring Vaseline, somewhat embarrassed about his tendency to have nosebleeds.

The mother matter-of-factly stated that Dexter sometimes gets nosebleeds and knows what to do about them.

Dexter protested that he knows what to do about his nosebleeds and that he hates the need to carry the Vaseline.

Dexter made a comment about his cousin Christie, who is much smaller, being able to throw a ball into a basket with ease.

The father warned Dexter that the basketball hoop was set too low and expressed concern about Dexter breaking it.

Dexter insisted he would not break the hoop and noted it belonged to a toy astronaut and space ship playset.

The father cautioned Dexter that if he broke the toy, he would have to get a replacement because it was not just a toy but part of a game set.

Dexter persisted in saying the item was just a toy and not a game, showing his literal interpretation of definitions.

Dexter asked when he might get a real basketball instead of playing with toy versions.

Dexter pointed out that he already owns a real football but admitted he does not know how to play football well.

Dexter mentioned possessing a real tennis racket and a real baseball bat, indicating he had several sporting goods.

Dexter asked where his real baseball bat was located, suggesting some confusion about where his equipment was stored.

The father mentioned a skating rink located near his office that was being prepared for the bicentennial celebration.

The father explained that the bicentennial was a celebration of the nation's two hundredth birthday and various anniversaries.

The father pointed out that Rockefeller Center was putting up flags all around, specifically from the United Nations nations.

The father asked Dexter if he remembered visiting the skating rink near his office building.

Dexter eagerly asked if his father could go look at the skating rink and the flags when he went to work that day.

The father agreed and indicated he intended to visit the skating rink to see the bicentennial preparations.

When the mother asked what was happening, Dexter explained about the United Nations flags being put up for the bicentennial.

The mother asked if the flag raising was happening that very day, and Dexter confirmed it was.

The mother commented that the bicentennial preparations seemed to be happening quite early and noted the involvement of bands and noise before nine o'clock.

The mother prepared tissues for Dexter and placed them in his pocket in case he needed them at school, instructing him to keep them handy.

The mother told Dexter to put on his coat, and he began to prepare to leave for school.

The mother asked if Dexter had gotten his scarf, and he acknowledged that he had not brought it yet.

The mother insisted that Dexter needed his scarf because it might be chilly outside, and she asked where it was.

The mother searched for Dexter's yellow scarf and discovered that his brother David had been wearing it that morning.

The mother offered Dexter a different scarf to wear instead of his yellow one.

Dexter indicated that the alternative scarf was too long for him to wear comfortably.

The investigator heard his name being called and was informed the family was getting ready to leave.

The mother asked about Dexter's yellow scarf one more time, confirming that David had taken it that morning.

The mother and investigator prepared to depart, with Dexter asking what was going to happen next.

Dexter noticed on television that boy scouts and girl scouts were present at the flag-raising event at Rockefeller Center.

The mother confirmed that the scouts were indeed participating in the bicentennial celebration.

Dexter asked who the man in charge of the event was, and the mother informed him it was the president of Rockefeller Center.

When Dexter questioned if this was Rockefeller, the mother clarified that the person was the president of Rockefeller Center, not Rockefeller himself.

Dexter observed that there were girl scouts positioned on either side of something in the television image.

The mother instructed someone named Jerry that they were ready to leave and asked Dexter if he had his school bag.

Dexter indicated that he knew the mother had the bag or asked what she was going to do regarding the bag.

Dexter asked what they were going to do and noted something was working, suggesting he was playing with something.

The father produced the school bag for Dexter, but Dexter said he would not put it on until later, though he agreed to put it on immediately.

The investigator acknowledged Dexter and referred to his mother as Missus Davenport, stating he was ready if she was.

The mother confirmed they were ready to leave, and the investigator indicated agreement to depart.

The mother offered to apply some substance to Dexter, noting he knows it is windy outside.

Dexter disagreed about the weather, saying it was sunny and not windy at all.

The mother disagreed with Dexter's assessment and told him to wait until he got outside to see that it was indeed windy.

Dexter echoed his mother's words back to her but insisted the wind would not blow him away, only across the street at most.

The mother reminded Dexter to get his gloves before leaving, as they would need them outside.

The mother told Dexter the wind might blow him away, and he insisted it could only blow him across the street, not blow him away entirely.

Dexter asked if the investigator was taking all their equipment and supplies over to his school.

The investigator confirmed he would do so and noted he had been commissioned to carry the equipment.

Dexter asked the investigator to throw all the stuff on his back and then asked when the microphone or recording device would come off him.

The mother instructed Dexter to turn off the television before they left the house.

The investigator accidentally bumped into someone while moving toward the door, apologizing for the collision.

The father told Dexter to have fun at school and to see him later, using a casual goodbye.

The father instructed Dexter to take something out of his mouth, specifically a string he was chewing on.

The investigator joked that he could go out if the school did not provide lunch, showing he was unconcerned about missing a meal.

The mother indicated that they generally did have lunch at school, though she did not have the menu for that particular week.

The father said goodbye again as the family prepared to leave.

The investigator said goodbye and indicated he would see them later.

The mother suddenly remembered that Dexter needed his shopping bag and pointed out that he had to have it.

Dexter insisted he did not need his shopping bag, arguing against his mother's requirement.

The mother explained why the shopping bag was necessary, noting that Dexter changes to a different classroom floor in the afternoon.

The mother stated that students are supposed to put their coats and other items in the bag to carry upstairs between classrooms.

Dexter acknowledged that he knew about this procedure and understood the necessity of having his shopping bag.

The father handed the shopping bag to Dexter, ensuring he had it for school.

The investigator acknowledged understanding the purpose of the shopping bag and said goodbye again as they prepared to leave.

The mother suggested taking the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator, possibly to save time or because the elevator was slow.

Dexter noted that the elevator they had been using was the fast elevator, questioning his mother's choice to use the stairs.

The mother acknowledged the elevator was fast but expressed concern they might have to wait for it, so the stairs would be more reliable.

The mother asked the investigator to let them know if they were moving too fast for him on the stairs.

The investigator reassured the family he only needed a little extra time before they continued, so he could keep up.

The mother told Dexter to stop fooling around or misbehaving as they made their way out of the apartment.

Someone unknown to the main speakers greeted Dexter by his nickname, saying hello Decky.

The investigator greeted them back with a good morning salutation.

Dexter called his mother's attention to something, saying see Ma and trying to show her something outside.

The mother responded that it was not bad at all and looked at the weather conditions on the street.

The investigator commented that the scene was very nice, showing appreciation for what they could see outside.

The mother noted that the sun was now on their side of the street, and they could see it well from where they were standing.

The investigator asked if the mother and Dexter ever got a lot of sun where they lived.

The mother explained that they get significant sun only in the summer time when they do not really need it.

The mother described an educational conversation she had with Dexter about how the sun appears to move but actually the earth is rotating.

The mother noted that Dexter had wondered when the sun would move over to their side of the building from where it currently was.

Dexter pointed out that the sun was over there and would come over to their location later.

The mother asked Dexter what time he thought the sun would get to their side of the building.

Dexter initially guessed it would be at lunchtime, but then changed his mind and said it would not be at lunchtime.

The mother suggested that the sun would be on their side in the afternoon, noting that it moved throughout the day.

Dexter disagreed and reminded his mother that by the time they returned home, the sun would already be gone, indicating evening would have arrived.

The mother agreed with Dexter's observation that the sun would be gone by evening time.

The mother noted that because they were now on daylight saving time, it might stay lighter longer in the evenings.

Dexter pointed out logically that the sun cannot be there during nighttime hours.

Dexter noted they leave at evening time, when it is still a bit light but getting darker.

The mother agreed and explained that it would not be as dark when they leave in the evening as it had been in previous weeks.

Dexter remembered an incident from the previous day involving a Columbia University student and high winds.

The mother described how a Columbia student's notebook and papers had been blown around by the strong wind the day before.

The mother explained that the papers and pages had gone everywhere, blown down the street and up into the air.

The investigator asked if the papers had scattered widely, and the mother confirmed they had gone everywhere.

The mother sympathized with the student's misfortune regarding his blown-away papers.

Dexter recalled that the student had claimed the papers were blank, though the mother had seen writing on them.

The mother speculated that the student did not want people to feel too sorry for him and claimed the papers were blank to downplay the loss.

The family and investigator proceeded toward the school, with the mother suggesting they take a shortcut rather than the regular route.

The investigator acknowledged the shortcut and indicated he understood the route they would be taking.

Dexter joked about what would happen if their shortcut was locked and they could not use it.

The mother began to explain what they would have to do if the shortcut was not available.

Dexter denied that the shortcut was locked, reassuring his mother it was accessible.

The mother cautioned Dexter not to trick her by saying the shortcut was locked when it actually was.

Dexter insisted he was not tricking and asked a sincere question about what would happen if the shortcut actually was locked.

The mother acknowledged Dexter's question and explained they would need to check inside an elevator to see where his classroom was located.

The mother suggested they would look inside the elevator to determine if Dexter's class was outside on the playground or inside the building.

The mother noted that the elevator had stopped on one end, which might be a sign of where the class was gathering.

Dexter asked his mother if she knew what the sign meant regarding his classroom location.

The mother indicated she thought Dexter's class was on one end of the building, expressing her best guess.

Dexter suggested his classmates might be on a different floor level from where his mother was suggesting.

The mother asked Dexter what was located on the floor level he mentioned, trying to figure out the classroom location.

Dexter answered that the office was on that floor level.

The mother reasoned that if the office was on that floor, then the class must be on the other end of the building.

Dexter expressed confidence that his class was always on one end of the building, basing his statement on regular experience.

The mother noted that being on one end meant the class was probably on the playground.

The mother warned Dexter to watch his fingers and be careful with the elevator door as they rode it.

The investigator commented that elevators could be tricky and unpredictable sometimes.

The mother noted that they had not yet seen any of Dexter's classmates or friends on the way to school.

The investigator asked if the mother meant they had not seen anyone on the way to school so far.

The mother confirmed that was what she meant and noted it was a bit early in the day for classmates to be around.

The mother warned Dexter not to touch the elevator buttons or put his fingers near the door, reminding him of school rules.

The mother asked Dexter what Mrs. had instructed about touching the elevator buttons.

Dexter recalled that Mrs. had said no touching the buttons.

The mother extended the rule to include not putting his fingers near the elevator door either.

The mother asked again where Dexter's gloves were, wanting to make sure he had them for outside.

Dexter insisted he could touch the buttons and asked where his gloves were in relation to his coat.

The mother repeatedly asked Dexter about his gloves, emphasizing the importance of having them.

Dexter finally admitted he only had one glove, causing concern from his mother about the missing second glove.

The mother expressed frustration that Dexter had not told her before they left home that he was missing a glove.

The investigator found the glove situation amusing and laughed at the discovery.

Dexter confirmed that he indeed only had one glove instead of two.

The mother expressed exasperation at Dexter's situation, calling him a crazy kid for losing one of his gloves.

The mother asked Dexter where his other glove had gone.

Dexter maintained that he only had the one glove he had brought with him.

The mother expressed skepticism about Dexter truly having only one glove when they left.

The mother wondered if Dexter had left the missing glove up in his classroom at school.

Dexter denied that the missing glove was in his classroom, suggesting it was somewhere else.

The mother asked Dexter where he thought the missing glove might be located.

The mother asked if Dexter thought the missing glove was left at home.

Dexter admitted that he had left the missing glove at home and had not brought it that day.

The mother expressed surprise that Dexter had left one of his gloves at home deliberately.

Dexter insisted that he left the glove at home every day, implying this was a regular occurrence.

The mother expressed doubt about Dexter's explanation, saying it did not seem right that he would do that repeatedly.

The mother pointed out that Dexter had brought his gloves with him the day before when they had gone out.

The mother decided she would go upstairs to Dexter's classroom to check if the missing glove was left there.

The mother said goodbye to Dexter, indicating she was going to search for the missing glove in his classroom.

Dexter said bye to his mother as she left to search for the missing glove.

The investigator acknowledged the situation and expressed understanding.

The mother informed the investigator that Mrs. Muehler, presumably Dexter's teacher, knew that Dexter was coming to school.

The investigator acknowledged the information about the teacher being aware of Dexter's arrival.

The mother stated she did know about the teacher's awareness, even if Dexter did not know about it yet.

The mother indicated that Dexter needed to take something with him, referring to one of the items they had prepared earlier.

The mother asked if Dexter did not use something the mother had instructed about.

Throughout the morning, various family members and the investigator engaged with Dexter in conversation about school preparations, television programs, toys, and physical activities.

The session showcased typical family dynamics of getting a young child ready for school, including negotiations about clothing, equipment, and behavioral expectations.

Dexter's language development, curiosity about his world, and interactions with multiple adults demonstrated his engagement with both structured and unstructured learning opportunities.
