============================================================
NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Jessica and Andy began their sandbox play by addressing the hungry baby lion cubs who needed food and a nap.

Andy announced an attack was coming, and Jessica asked what kind of attack while they decided which character would be the bad guy.

Jessica selected the sharptooth as the bad guy, and Andy agreed, creating a conflict scenario between good and bad characters.

A dramatic battle ensued where the sharptooth and another character fought, with Andy suggesting all characters were bad guys.

Jessica introduced a stegosaurus that came running in and blasted the bad dinosaur on the head.

The father dinosaur came running out and fought, eventually causing the bad character to fall dead in Jessica's imagination.

Jessica wanted all the animals to play in the fight together, making it more complex than a simple good-versus-bad scenario.

Chanel joined briefly to show Jessica and Andy a salmon and an octopus, and they negotiated trading for these new animals.

Jessica and Andy absorbed the new ocean creatures into their dinosaur game, creating a hybrid animal story.

Chanel left but the children continued discussing her animals, with Jessica noting they're playing dinosaurs and animals together.

Katie F. and Kate joined the game, and Jessica and Andy were very excited to have more players.

The children debated whose baby belonged to whom and whose animals were which, creating playful ownership disputes.

Jessica made a dramatic phone call for a "teacher to move people," creating an interruption that Andy rejected.

Katie (KT) arrived and positioned herself to participate, though there were concerns about available space.

A new character arrived, and the children acted out defensive behavior, with Katie saying monsters shouldn't hurt babies.

Joshua, Eric, and Scottie joined the play, bringing new energy and expanding the cast of characters significantly.

The boys created a scenario where they talked about whether someone was a bad guy and who needed to be protected.

A complex narrative developed with multiple children discussing who were good guys and who were bad guys.

Joshua expressed worry about a "bad Jessica" and whether they would get put in jail or kissed by bad people.

Eric discussed how sometimes people put you in jail, and Joshua claimed they were too little to be jailed anyway.

A competition developed about who had more animals, with Joshua competing against Eric for collection ownership.

Joshua discovered he had a cut on his foot and showed it to the others, wondering how a bug might have caused it.

The narrative shifted to a gas station scenario where Joshua insisted elephants don't need gas, only cars do.

Joshua, Eric, and Scottie created a robot character from outer space, developing an increasingly complex military narrative.

Joshua claimed to be a robot from outer space, and the other boys echoed or modified this character claim.

The boys discussed tying up the robot and putting him in jail at lunchtime because he was a bad guy.

Andy and Joshua returned to the sandbox play area and discovered a flying toy or garage toy that needed assembly.

They discussed making a giant garage with doors that opened and closed, adding walls and protection structures.

Andy and Joshua negotiated about needing guns and missiles for protection, with Andy saying "no guns in school."

They discussed whether they needed bombs for protection and whether cows could help defend against attacks.

The children debated needing missiles and weapons to protect a structure from "the brontosaurus" or other bad guys.

Joshua and Andy worked together to gather materials and build protective barriers around their garage structure.

A conversation broke out about who had how many cars, with the children comparing their collections and arguing about fairness.

Joshua insisted he could do a somersault and the children discussed rocket mechanics and how missiles work.

The narrative developed where the missiles would shoot off after firecrackers or charges, creating a more explosive scenario.

Andy and Joshua continued construction while Scottie and the other boys incorporated their robot character into a capture scenario.

The children discussed kidnapping and freeing the robot, with Joshua saying "charge!" and attacking the structure.

Andy wanted to move his car out of the garage quickly and called "Cobra!" referring to the G.I. Joe villain character.

Joshua claimed to be the boss and told Andy to ask him for permission, establishing a hierarchy in their play.

Lengthy discussions about who was sharing what toys and whether Joshua had ninjas or other collectible figures occurred.

Andy and Joshua discussed G.I. Joe toys, lunch boxes, and toy stores, shifting into a competitive discussion about possessions.

Joshua became frustrated, saying "you always tease me" in response to Andy boasting about toys he claimed to have.

The play turned to military themes with Joshua saying "now it's time to kill you" and "I'm gonna break your neck off!"

Chanel suddenly announced a show featuring lions, calling all the kids up on stage to present "the lions of all speech."

Chanel narrated a lion show with specific named characters (Chambol, Neemo, and Doonolotto) and described what type of event it would be.

The final sequence featured Chanel directing a "scary" lion show where mommies would have to fight, and Alice agreed to make a train track.
