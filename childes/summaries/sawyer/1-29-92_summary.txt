NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Katie (KF) tells Jessica (JW) that she's a lawyer and needs to help with bad trouble involving a robber.

Jessica and Rebecca (R) discuss plans where Katie will go to somebody's house while they stay to keep peace.

Katie explains the dangerous situation: there are robbers stealing, and as a lawyer she'll help catch them.

Jessica asks about Katie's baby, noting she's "naked," and the group decides to dress and put the baby in bed.

Katie prepares to leave for work to catch the robber, putting on her coat and keys.

Jessica and Rebecca dress the baby and debate whether the baby needs underpants or undergarments.

Katie returns home from work and everyone admires the dressed baby who is now ready for bed.

The telephone rings repeatedly throughout the session, with various children playing phone operators and callers.

Katie declares she must get to work if she's going to catch the robber today.

The group transitions from baby care into an extended family dinner scenario.

Youngeun (Y) arrives and the children celebrate, noting she "made it" by nine o'clock for dinner.

Katie assigns family roles: Ken (KN) becomes a kitty cat, while Jessica is the mother.

Children prepare and serve dinner to the kitty cat, with Rebecca insisting "Get back in your house!"

As the kitty cat, Ken keeps bothering the dinner party while Jessica and others try to maintain peace.

Katie and others serve tea, plates, and various food items while managing the misbehaving kitty cat.

Katie threatens that anyone misbehaving won't get ice cream, only plain dinner.

After dinner, the teacher (MB) reminds the children to keep the noise down.

Katie announces bedtime and directs everyone to their assigned beds.

As children get in bed, Katie shifts roles to perform Santa Claus, singing "ho ho ho."

Katie sings Christmas and Jingle Bells songs while children pretend to sleep.

The next morning arrives and Katie announces daytime, bringing out candy as Santa's present.

Katie transitions to Easter Bunny, declaring "I am the Easter Bunny" repeatedly.

Children hide under blankets while Katie plays the Easter Bunny looking for them.

Katie eventually moves into a good witch role offering ice cream instead of the bad witch character.

Katie and others conclude the afternoon by playing a detailed animal card game with specific animals being drawn.

The teacher (MB) facilitates the card game, asking children to identify and match animals.

Children identify animals including ostrich, porcupine, donkey, camel, turkey, kangaroo, lion, hippo, and bunny.

The session concludes with the teacher commenting it's been "a good game" of animal matching.
