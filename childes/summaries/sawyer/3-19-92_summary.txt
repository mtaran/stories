NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Children engaged in dinosaur-based pretend play where one child took the role of a dinosaur character while another directed the narrative: "pretend the dinosaur so strong that he could take the."

A mother character was introduced into the scenario, with children deciding "pretend the mother" would enter the play and establishing the mother's narrative role and responsibilities.

The scenario included threat elements where children discussed "when bad guys come" and established that the mother character needed to provide protective response or intervention.

Children introduced medicine into the narrative, with discussion about "this medicine comes from for this" and establishing that characters might need medicinal assistance or healing.

A "little foot" character was introduced into the dinosaur and mother scenario, suggesting multiple characters engaged in a family or adventure narrative together.

The mother character was described as going away or leaving, with children directing: "the mother went and she called," establishing separation and communication themes.

Children negotiated who would be included in the scenario, with reference to "Mrs White" as someone a character would tell or report to, introducing an authority figure outside the immediate peer group.

The scenario concluded with children discussing what would happen to the mother, with one child proposing: "Alice pretend the mother was dead," introducing dramatic consequences to character scenarios.

Children navigated the emotional weight of this proposal by adding elements of resurrection or continuation: "pretend little foot woke up," suggesting that even with death narratives, play could continue with new developments.

The short session showed children's engagement with complex scenarios combining dinosaurs, family roles, danger, and emotional narrative elements in a relatively brief interaction.
