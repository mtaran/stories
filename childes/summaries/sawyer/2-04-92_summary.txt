NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Joshua shows Nick a toy dinosaur that is a T-Rex, and Jessica mentions that there is a slide on top of the bathroom in their pretend construction.

Joshua brings toys for Nick to play with and Nick asks which one is his, which Joshua clarifies.

Jessica and Joshua share toys while pretend-playing with dinosaurs and various plastic animals.

Joshua demonstrates a dragon toy with a sword that comes out, surprising Jessica who didn't know about the sword mechanism.

Jessica and Joshua engage in elaborate pretend-play where dinosaurs are pretending to look after their children, and Jessica establishes a bedtime.

Joshua suggests that dragons are grown up and get to stay up longer than children.

Nick and Joshua create scenarios involving dinosaurs and farm animals, with Joshua acting as the crocodile while they discuss whether animals are good or bad guys.

Jessica proposes they imagine that these animals were dogs, and Nick makes barking sounds, while Joshua establishes that some animal figures are the bad guys and Captain Hook is a villain.

Joshua needs farm animals for hunting, and Mother Bolton helps distribute materials, allowing Joshua to choose two items to give away and keep two.

Jessica protects the farm animals from Joshua's crocodile, warning him not to eat them and explaining that the crocodile's mother is an animal too.

Joshua and Jessica develop a complex pretend scenario involving cops, helicopters, and a bad guy who has escaped from jail.

Joshua becomes a robot from outer space who helps rescue a girl who was trapped up high.

Jessica calls out for Cera, seemingly referencing a dinosaur character who is lost or in danger.

The children create a rescue scenario where they try to help Cera and keep her from falling into the water.

Joshua and Nick transition from the rescue play to building something new, debating over the best location to build.

Joshua advocates that there is a bigger space and more fun items available in another location, including a radio.

Children begin building a parking lot structure, discussing how their toy figures can park and drive around.

Joshua and Nicholas celebrate their completed parking lot and show it to adults who appreciate their construction.

Musab and Matthew discuss and build their own tower structures, comparing who has the biggest and tallest creation.

Matthew gets multiple towers and blocks, challenging Musab on who has more, and the children discuss the size of their buildings.

The teacher tells the children it is time for cleanup and begins putting some toys away to free up space for others.

Joshua enthusiastically shows off his fire-breathing dragon toy to adults in the classroom.

Ben and Scottie construct a car together with Scottie providing the materials and the two negotiating what the car will be like.

Joshua and Nick examine and play with a funny-looking car that Nick has made, pretending it can drive.

Children argue about who has which toys and people, with Nick noting his funny car and Joshua making car sounds.

Benjamin says his structure is the Sears Tower while Musab claims his is bigger than Benjamin's tower.

Children continue playing with various toy figures, making vehicle sounds and testing what their creations can do.

The teacher asks who can help clean up and begins organizing cleanup time at the end of the session.

Eric, Jessica, and others respond to cleanup instructions and begin putting blocks and toys into designated areas.
