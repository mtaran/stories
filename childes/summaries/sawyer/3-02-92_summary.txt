============================================================
NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Andy, Chanel, and Jessica began their construction by building separate houses in the block area.

Andy announced his houses had slingshots that shoot off, creating weapons for his design.

Chanel suggested that instead of guns, they should use magnets that could suck things, proposing a non-violent alternative.

Andy insisted he was making two houses with a big machine on top that could kill bad guys with electric power.

Chanel described her house also having electric power that could suck people up like a vacuum system.

Jessica criticized the focus on weapons, saying weapons are not the kind of thing to play with.

Andy and Chanel continued describing their elaborate houses with secret weapons and technical specifications.

The children agreed they were done building and wanted to show the teacher their creations.

Andy pointed out that his houses had flying saucers on the sides in case they wanted to kill people.

Jessica watched from the sidelines, not emphasizing weapons in her construction like Andy and Chanel did.

All three children had created very tall structures and wanted to play with animals in their houses.

A transition occurred where children began discussing what would happen with bad guys and evil characters.

Chanel narrated "it is midnight now" as she began a new storyline where bad guys were causing trouble.

Jessica narrated that a longneck dinosaur heard something and could fight back against bad guys.

Chanel and Jessica collaborated on a scenario where the longneck animals beat up bad guys who had armor.

The bad guys were described as having special characteristics that made them dangerous and required defense mechanisms.

The children discussed electricity as a weapon to suck bad guys up, referencing their earlier house designs.

A narrative developed where longnecks were keeping guard against bad guys, and Jessica said "got him" when capturing someone.

The teacher joined the conversation and noted it was hot, while the children discussed playing outside without coats.

Jessica and the teacher discussed what they had done yesterday, with Jessica mentioning playing with Jessica (herself) all day.

The teacher complimented Chanel's shirt and asked how she was doing.

Chanel narrated that bad guys were hurt but came back up, shifting the narrative toward resurrection and ongoing conflict.

Jessica described the longneck dinosaurs could kill the bad guys, creating a protective scenario.

Andy pointed out what he did with the dinosaur's hair, and the teacher compared it to a house.

Jessica narrated that one dinosaur fell on Andy's house, creating an accident in their combined narrative.

Chanel established that everybody came out to have a meeting where bad guys were watching.

Andy described hippopotamus and lion characters with weapons that could attack bad guys.

Jessica described Sarah sleeping in the grave house, establishing a nested narrative where one location was inside another.

Chanel called for everyone to come to a meeting and get attention, creating urgency in their play.

A chaos moment occurred when Andy knocked something over with a missile, and it fell on the animals.

Jessica expressed disbelief that Chanel had knocked down her "Sears Tower," feeling angry that her structure was destroyed.

Andy explained the missile came by and shot it, blew back instead of at the bad guys, and accidentally killed a lion.

The teacher intervened, reminding Andy that Jessica wanted to play with him and shouldn't be left out.

The teacher warned Andy that if he left Jessica out, "the game's over" and instructed him to include her.

Jessica protested loudly, saying "I'm not playing this anymore!" and announced she would play with herself instead.

Andy and Chanel decided to continue their game with flying saucers and bad guys despite Jessica's withdrawal.

Chanel described bad guys trying to get a baby, with oxygen and electricity burning them up and making them cry.

A final sequence involved other children at the opposite end of the room discussing cows, bulls, and cowboys.

Jeremy spoke to the researcher Keith about the microphone and whether it was a radio.

Eric and Scottie had an extensive debate about whether specific animals were cows or bulls, with disagreements about which was bigger.

The game concluded as cleanup time was announced and Eric protested about not wanting to knock down their structures.
