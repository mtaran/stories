NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Katie (KF) shows Jessica (J2) her special items: a cupcake with decorations, a blankie for her baby, and a coat she wore as a baby.

Jessica admires Katie's baby's blankie and asks about a snuggly (stuffed animal) that Katie keeps in her cubby.

Katie sings "Who's that doggie in the window?" and talks to the baby with silly language.

Jessica volunteers to be the babysitter while Katie goes somewhere important.

Rebecca (R) arrives and Katie shows her the bathtub and baba (bottle) items for the baby.

The group discusses being cold from going outside and needing to warm up.

Katie says Youngeun (Y) will arrive at eight o'clock for a party celebration.

Rebecca worries about a storm coming at nine o'clock, but Katie assures her it won't happen before eight.

Katie tells the group that three robbers are coming to town to steal money from people.

The children lock doors by finding keys and preparing defenses against the robbers.

Jessica and Rebecca engage in "homework" while the robbers are coming tomorrow.

Katie describes good guys coming next week who will "beat them up" to protect the town.

Youngeun arrives and Katie greets her enthusiastically, noting she "made it" by dinner time.

The group sets up beds and discusses sleep arrangements for the evening.

Katie announces it's eight o'clock and Santa Claus is coming, so everyone must go to sleep.

Children put on pajamas while Katie repeatedly sings modified Christmas songs.

Jessica suggests they should wrap presents since Santa Claus is coming.

Katie performs as Santa Claus, saying "ho ho ho" and moving around as if delivering gifts.

Morning arrives and Katie reveals that Santa brought candy and big shoes (ruby slippers).

Katie and others transition to Easter Bunny play, with Katie declaring "I am the Easter Bunny" repeatedly.

Children hide under blankets while Katie searches for them as the Easter Bunny.

Katie tickles the children as the Easter Bunny and then transitions to a good witch offering ice cream.

The teacher (MC) interrupts the Halloween witch play and directs children toward cleanup.

The group plays an extended animal card game where the teacher reveals animal cards and children guess them.

Animals identified include deer, squirrel, gorilla, sheep, water buffalo, cow, ostrich, wolf, porcupine, donkey, camel, turkey, kangaroo, lion, hippo, and bunny.

Children continue the card game while the teachers organize cleanup of the block area.
