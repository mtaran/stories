============================================================
NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Jessica began the session alone, expressing wonder about cute things and engaging in imaginative monologue about puppies and an old pal returning to visit, establishing an emotional narrative about reunion.

At the work tables, children engaged in collaborative painting where Chanel, Andy, Rebecca, and Katie negotiated access to the purple paint, with Chanel requesting it repeatedly while Andy and Jessica took turns with the shared color.

Katie needed spelling help to write her name on paper, with another child helping her spell "Katie Lastname" while Katie carefully executed the written representation of her identity.

The children created folded paper butterflies as an activity, with Jessica excited about her creation while Katie expressed desire to make another one, showing engagement with the art project.

In the doll corner, Katie established a comprehensive family scenario where she was a queen, Youngeun was a princess, Alexa was a neighbor/lady, and Eric was a king visiting their home.

Katie developed elaborate protocols for the pretend home, explaining that visitors must knock on the door and Alexa (the neighbor) had to put on a jacket before entering, establishing clear role boundaries and behaviors.

Alexa objected to being designated as a neighbor, negotiating instead to be a "lady" and questioning Katie's logic about what designation meant, leading to Katie's explanation that "lady means neighbor."

Katie explained that Youngeun was the biggest family member and could play with electricity from the telephone, while Alexa as a littler girl was forbidden from playing with the phone's electricity.

The doll corner family scenario included establishing sleeping arrangements, with Katie showing Alexa her designated bed under the table while negotiating blanket colors and comfort items.

Katie assigned Youngeun as the princess with special status, Eric as the king who could sleep on momma's bed, while Rebecca became a visiting princess and others took on supporting roles with specific responsibilities.

A discussion about whether it was Monday or Tuesday emerged, with Katie establishing "for real, today is Tuesday" while explaining that in their pretend scenario it was a different day, showing metacognitive awareness.

When new children arrived (Jeremy, Scott, Musab), Katie initiated a scenario about "strange boys" coming to the house, recruiting Eric to help identify and manage these supposed intruders in their pretend home.

The children negotiated whether the "strange boys" (Jeremy and Scott) were "good boys" or bad boys who needed to be locked out, with Eric defending their inclusion while Katie maintained skeptical caution.

Musab claimed to be a "good turtle" while demonstrating his role, and the children discussed playing as Ninja Turtles with established character identities and moral statuses in the pretend scenario.

An incident occurred where someone "tied the king up," creating a moment of dramatic crisis in the pretend narrative that required the children to resolve through further negotiation.

The teacher (MW) intervened in the play when conflicts escalated, asking the children to put toys away and transition to cleanup time, with the children gradually disengaging from the elaborate doll corner scenario.
