NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Katie (KF) takes on the role of a nurse who is delivering babies to other children in an extended healthcare roleplay.

Katie calls Benjamin (B) on the telephone to ask if he wants babies delivered, using a professional nurse voice.

Katie describes having babies available for ordering, including a black baby for Youngeun and another for Rebecca (R).

She guides Youngeun through the process of opening a "present" with a surprise baby inside.

Rebecca and Youngeun examine their baby, with Rebecca remarking that her baby looks like her and has no hair.

Katie performs baby care demonstrations, including feeding, diaper changes, and talking to the baby.

She sings lullabies about blue shadows and little cowboys to put the babies to sleep.

Rebecca and Youngeun pretend to be teenagers preparing for bed, claiming they are big girls, not mothers.

Katie shifts the play to Santa Claus arriving, insisting everyone must go to sleep before he comes.

While singing Christmas songs, Katie warns Rebecca that "Santa can see you" if she doesn't close her eyes.

Katie offers a necklace as incentive for Rebecca to keep her eyes closed during the Santa roleplay.

The teacher (MC) interrupts the ongoing Santa play to note they're having cleanup time.

Katie announces the Easter Bunny is coming, and children hide under blankets as Katie performs Easter Bunny antics.

Katie transitions to a Halloween witch character, offering ice cream to the children as a good witch.

The witch character eventually becomes evil, and Katie declares "she's dead now" after "shooting her."

Rebecca expresses eagerness to clean up the mess, but Katie suggests she doesn't want to clean up yet.

Katie and Youngeun prepare to go outside, with Katie singing about being "Three Amigos."

The teacher (MB) asks children to help with cleanup, reminding them it's time to put materials away.

Rebecca celebrates finding a quarter on the ground during cleanup activities.

Children mention playing in the snow and that school was canceled because of weather conditions.

Youngeun arrives late and joins the group for dinner roleplay.

The group engages in an extended tea party and meal preparation with assigned family roles.

Ken (KN) plays a kitty cat while Jessica (JW) and others serve tea and food to the "pet."

Katie repeatedly instructs everyone to be quiet and not scream during the peaceful dinner.

As dinner progresses, children negotiate plates, silverware, and who gets what food items.

Katie threatens that anyone who misbehaves won't get dessert, establishing dinner rules.

After dinner, Katie announces ice cream time and names the flavor as chocolate repeatedly.
