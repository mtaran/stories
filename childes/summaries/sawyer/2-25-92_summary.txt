NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Andy and Joshua began building a rocket with firecrackers, discussing how the firecrackers would shoot off and light up.

Joshua suggested using firecrackers to turn on lights, and the boys counted out blocks to distribute between them.

They assembled rockets with firecrackers on top, negotiating ownership of different pieces and piles of figures.

The boys practiced countdown sequences ("five four three two one blastoff!") as they played with their toy figures and rockets.

The researcher Keith arrived and spoke with Chanel's father about being a linguistics graduate student studying the classroom.

Eric mentioned he was three and four months old and claimed to be the "sword guy" with dinosaurs and a farm.

Andy and Eric had built a very tall castle together, which the teacher warned might fall down on Joshua.

Joshua requested to play G.I. Joe, proposing to make a G.I. Joe rocket with missiles while other children played with animals.

A prolonged language negotiation occurred between Andy and Joshua about the word "tank"—Joshua repeatedly confused it with "tape" causing frustration.

After finally understanding "tank," Joshua agreed to help build a giant four-way tank.

The boys discussed whether they needed missiles and bombs for their tank construction, debating what weapons would be necessary.

They determined they didn't need bombs but made a large tank to place over their spaceship.

Benjamin and Ben were engaged in other play, with the teacher redirecting Ben away from jumping on blocks.

The children named characters from Ninja Turtles—Eric chose Donatello, Scottie picked Michaelangelo and Raphael, while others joined in.

Andy and Joshua turned their construction into a structure where G.I. Joe figures could walk across pathways between Andy's and Joshua's sides.

They created walkways using blocks so their figures could traverse from one end to the other.

Joshua's figures and Andy's figures were organized on opposite sides, with the ability to cross through the middle section.

The boys discussed a G.I. Joe general that was "bigger than big" and decided to make their structure even larger.

They continued adding missiles and building components to create an increasingly elaborate military structure.

Andy demonstrated how to lock pieces together by rotating them in a specific sequence.

As cleanup time approached, Andy asked if it was time to clean up, and the teacher confirmed they needed to begin dismantling their tower.

The teacher offered to help Andy take down the very high tower he had built before cleanup time ended.
