============================================================
NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

A caregiver and child engaged in pretend play involving the management of multiple toy babies, with the child explaining that they had given some babies away because there were too many to keep.

The child discussed keeping specific babies while managing the logistics of baby care, mentioning that some cousins were "too poor" to have their own babies and discussing dressing babies in clothes.

The child described a transition to school preparation, indicating it was time to "get dressed go to young to school" and negotiating whether they wanted to be the "big sister" in the pretend scenario.

Discussion included bathroom needs and procedures for using the toilet, with the caregiver establishing clear protocols that the child should ask for bathroom visits.

The child engaged in affectionate exchange with the caregiver, stating "I love you" multiple times, while the caregiver reciprocated and established boundaries about which individuals deserved affection.

The play scenario shifted to vehicle-based pretend play involving cars and school transportation, with the caregiver assigning vehicle roles and establishing where different individuals could sit.

The child was reminded about proper seating procedures, with the caregiver explaining "you have to sit in the rocking chair" or designated seating areas rather than alternative locations.

A second caregiver (PAR2) entered the scenario and established firm behavioral expectations about not leaving the school without teacher supervision, warning that this is "a very dangerous habit" to break.

The child engaged in extended dialogue about cleanup time, distinguishing between playtime and cleanup responsibilities while being redirected toward transition activities and teacher expectations.
