============================================================
NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Joshua and Musab began building structures in the block area, discussing who had bosses and stronger characters.

Michael joined nearby and built his own cage with lots of rooms, establishing a separate construction area.

Joshua described his cage as having many rooms where his animal could get out and check the other one whenever he wanted.

Musab suggested they pretend to go on a mission to meet their friends and sail away on their ship.

Joshua confirmed they could make their own rooms rather than using existing ones in Musab's submarine.

Musab explained that his submarine could go underwater and didn't have propellers like a helicopter.

Joshua created a submarine jack as his vehicle, and they discussed the differences between their submarine designs.

Joshua and Musab negotiated who would go back home and who would stay, establishing a back-and-forth mission structure.

They described making lots of guns and missiles on their structures to kill bad guys.

Joshua explained that missiles are things like guns that kill bad guys, providing a definition for Musab.

Musab showed Joshua how many missiles he had, and Joshua responded by working on his "zappers."

Joshua became concerned that Musab had accidentally bumped his structure and asked him to step carefully.

The children discussed who had the most missiles and tried to gather all available weapons from around the classroom.

Michael offered some weapons, but Joshua and Musab wanted them for themselves to add to their collections.

They discussed their white hat versus red hat alternatives and the colors available for their game.

Scottie asked if Joshua was going to play with them, but Joshua denied making that promise earlier.

Joshua and Musab argued about whether Joshua had said he would play with them, with clear disagreement.

Musab called Joshua "Joshies" and Joshua called Musab "Mus," creating nicknames for each other.

Joshua teased Musab by saying he would tell on him for not talking to him, establishing a friendship dynamic.

Joshua and Musab sang repetitive silly songs together, like "giraffe day here" with echoing and rhyming.

A minor conflict arose when Musab said "I dropped your head," and Joshua apologized saying "sorry sorry sorry."

When Musab said "that's okay," both boys and others started repeating "that's okay" in a chain reaction.

The teacher noticed the noise level and explained indoor versus outdoor voices, separating some children for animal lotto.

Joshua and Musab stayed together to continue their building project, pretending they were making a castle of a bad guy wizard.

Joshua described making a huge castle where bad wizards would live, and Musab offered to get animals for the wizards.

They debated whether certain figures were good wizards or bad wizards, creating tension in their story.

Joshua sang a repetitive song ("oh what did you kill Buffalo Bill") that became an earworm for both.

Musab suggested building bad wizards' houses while Joshua wanted to get a car for the wizard character.

The boys negotiated the roles and qualities of their wizard characters, arguing about disguises and whether good guys knew about bad guys.

Joshua showed Musab propellers that could turn when you push wheels, exciting Musab with the mechanical feature.

Joshua wanted to try making propellers work but Musab had had it first, creating a dispute over the toy.

Joshua asked repeatedly to try it with Musab's toy, and Musab eventually gave him a chance.

The boys discussed whose figures were good guys and whose were bad guys, with Joshua asserting his independence.

Joshua noticed Keith's watch and asked about its design, and Keith explained that the moon goes around the watch face.

Joshua asked why the moon changes phases, and Keith explained that when it's dark there's no moon visible.

Keith described the moon as currently being just a little piece of yellow, indicating a waning moon phase.

Joshua understood that the moon coming up shows it's almost nighttime, demonstrating comprehension of celestial mechanics.

Joshua and Musab discussed that nighttime was coming because it had been a long day, and soon the sun would come out again.

Other children began their own game discussions about taking things as adults, including ninja turtle references.

Jessica arrived and asked to play animals, and Joshua offered her the chance to get animals if she wanted.

Joshua and Musab discussed who could have which animals and how many each person could take.

Joshua returned to his equipment and found a flashlight, discovering that Michael knew how to screw it on better than others.

When Andy approached, Joshua told him the blocks were Michael's and Michael didn't want them anymore.

Andy complained that there was no one to play with him outside, but Jessica offered to play in the basement or outside.

Andy and Joshua discussed the foggy weather and whether visibility made it difficult for airports.

The teacher mentioned her husband was supposed to leave and hoped the fog would lift in time.

The children discussed several G.I. Joe toys and Cobra figures, with Andy showing Joshua the differences between them.

Andy described specific figures as having longer guns or being football players, sharing his toy knowledge.

Joshua wondered if a football-playing character also played football in the G.I. Joe show, asking Andy technical questions.

A cleanup announcement came, and Joshua asked if it had been five minutes of play time.

The teacher explained that everyone has to help clean up everyday, and Eric protested that he didn't make anything.
