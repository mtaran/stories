NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Katie and Youngeun engaged in pretend dinosaur play while discussing whether Katie's baby puppies walked or made sounds, establishing that the puppies might get lost if brought to school.

The children created an elaborate earthquake scenario in which everyone moved down and pretended to be unafraid, with Katie introducing the idea that dinosaurs were present in their imaginative setting.

Katie and Youngeun transitioned to sandbox play where they planned to dig "the deepest, deepest" hole to trap a character, with Katie directing the digging effort and establishing rules about where Youngeun could sit.

Scott joined the sandbox digging game and brought wild animals to participate, with Katie allowing him to keep only one animal such as an elephant, giraffe, or cow.

Katie established that the sandbox crew would clean up the area and transition to the doll corner to play with ruby slippers, announcing they were leaving the sandbox game.

Chanel and Andy engaged in extended, sophisticated negotiation about cobra toys and action-based pretend play, with Andy introducing a cobra that had "custom seats" and launching into Ninja Turtles-themed action scenarios.

Chanel and Andy established that characters lived in sewers and engaged in fighting, with Andy demonstrating what "cobra looks like" through descriptive language while Chanel requested specific fighting episodes.

Andy and Chanel negotiated the plot direction of their superhero scenario, with Andy determining that bad guys robbed a museum and tried to take characters to jail while good guys needed to rescue them.

The negotiation included complex conditional play statements where Andy would describe a situation and Chanel would respond with modifications, such as "pretend when you turned around the bad guys were in back of you, okay?"

Chanel and Andy reached agreement that their play involved both good guys and bad guys in conflict, with Andy saving Chanel's character from jail and Chanel expressing gratitude: "I love you for saving me!"

The extended play episode involved physical movements where Andy and Chanel demonstrated fighting kicks and impacts, with Andy describing "cobra kicks it!" while managing the toy's interactions.

Clean-up was announced as a transition activity, with Chanel volunteering to put toys in Andy's cubby while Andy confirmed they were "cleaning up" as the play episode concluded.
