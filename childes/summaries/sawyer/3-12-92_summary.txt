NARRATIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

Katie initiated an elaborate Peter Pan movie narrative for an audience, beginning with "once upon a time in London" and describing the Darling family who loved to see girlfriends while Momma and Father had opinions about the day.

Katie introduced Peter Pan as "the elf that would love to see girlfriends" and "a lost boy but he never grew up, never," establishing the central character's unique properties within the traditional story framework.

Katie elaborated that John and Michael Darling were "fighting right behind" other action, with Tinkerbell "arrived in Neverland" and Peter Pan being "in love," creating a complex romantic and dramatic narrative.

The movie narrative included Captain Hook capturing Tinkerbell and asking "Tinkerbell, where is your front house?" with Tinkerbell responding "I don't know!" establishing the villain's role and threat.

Katie described action involving Tiger Lily being "captured by Captain Hook" on "Rock Island" and Peter Pan's dramatic decision to help: "I'll help you" and "he saved Tiger Lily," introducing rescue themes.

The movie climax involved Peter Pan defeating Captain Hook who "swam away," with Katie narrating "the knight in the shadow. See the shadow?" creating a mysterious, visual conclusion to the narrative.

During the movie performance, Ken served as the "seller of soda pop" while other children requested popcorn, with the audience paying for tickets to see the Peter Pan "movie" presentation.

After the movie concluded, Katie transitioned to an "adventure" game where she directed children to "pack up and make a nice bed for the winter we're going."

Katie assigned children to find backpacks or use her backpack from her cubby, explaining "go get your backpacks and pack up everything" while establishing camping destination expectations.

Katie explained the transportation vehicles available: "we have two cars" with "this is the school bus" and "this is the car," giving children choices about which vehicle to board.

Johanna expressed wanting to go in the bus while several other children made the same request, creating a negotiation about limited vehicle capacity where Katie explained "there's only two people to come in the bus."

Katie directed children to pack specific items including blankets ("go get a blanket, and pack it, and put it in the car") and dishes for the camping scenario.

Children gathered items from the pretend camping supplies including ruby slippers, keys, necklaces, and purses, with Ken needing reminding that "only girls can wear ruby slippers" while he packed other items.

The camping episode began with Katie announcing "we're there" and instructing "everyone put your stuff on the grass," establishing the pretend campsite location.

Katie established safety rules for the campsite: "don't trip over the fire. It's gonna burn you" and explained that "the ice is for when we break our heads. The ice melts on your head and then the bones grow under."

Katie provided protection instructions against bears: "if you see a bear remember, put the ketchup on him because these things are bad," establishing a uniquely whimsical defense strategy.

Katie and Youngeun argued about camping bed position and sleeping arrangements, with Katie maintaining that "I'm the darkest" while organizing others' sleeping spaces.

Youngeun asked "who gonna drive the car?" and "who gonna drives the bus?" creating transportation negotiations about the camping vehicles, with Johanna claiming "I'm already driving the car."

Ken broke the "hook" which he initially denied, saying "I didn't!" before Katie and others confronted him with "you did it," and the teacher assured everyone "it's all right. Don't worry about it. We'll survive."

As the camping play progressed, children expressed various emotional states: "not me" in response to sleeping, "I am" in response to hunger, and "not me" in response to being scared.

Katie announced "here comes a bear!" initiating an emergency scenario where children needed to protect themselves, with some choosing to go under tables while others hid with "magic necklaces."

Ken, Johanna, Chanel, and Youngeun gathered "magic necklaces" for protection, with Katie declaring "I got my ruby slippers on" and Johanna saying "these necklaces will protect me especially."

Katie switched the emergency to "the wicked witch!" arriving at the campsite, requiring children to collect "magic necklaces" again while Katie specifically declared she had "my golden necklace."

The teacher (MC) announced "it's time to clean up ladies!" signaling the end of the camping episode and directing children to put "clothes back in the basket" and "toys, dishes in the cabinets please."
