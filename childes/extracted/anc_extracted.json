...\nthe father: too strong ?\nthe investigator: and this one is green everything is cool because it indicates the modulations of the voice ...\nthe father: mm .\nthe investigator: or whatever signal's being inputed , you know ?\nthe investigator: but this one , you know , lot of times it to me it , in the past it has meant that there's you know some kind of interference .\nthe investigator: and I just don't how to deal with it .\nthe investigator: because what it means is since I hafta transcribe that I hafta set there and listen real hard and stuff and I don't .\nthe father: oh .\nthe investigator: particularly wanna do that through hundred and forty tapes .\nthe father: .\nthe investigator: you know so but then it's all , , due to atmospheric conditions which change , drastically and that could be the reason why why your you know like your signal might be fading in and out .\nthe father: it does that from time to time .\nthe investigator: uhhuh yeah .\nthe father: are you ready Tony ?\nthe child: yeah .\nthe father: come on quit doing that .\nthe father: Tony there's people downstairs .\nthe investigator: well if it's alright with you I'm gonna leave ,

it ?\nthe investigator: can you dig it ?\nthe investigator: ?\nthe child: what or which ?\nthe child: shirt .\nthe child: that's route ?\nthe child: .\nthe father: the point is that the school didn't give it's consent .\nthe child: .\nthe investigator: well ...\nthe child: .\nthe father: maybe , you know if they would would have told me sooner maybe I might have been over .\nthe child: I told you no was stuck in the middle .\nthe investigator: well it ...\nthe child: .\nthe investigator: there's probably nothing that you could have done anyway .\nthe investigator: the school has their point of view and then as a parent have your point of view .\nthe investigator: and evidently the two just , you know don't coincide very well .\nthe father: well they seemed agree able to it at first though , so I would think , you know , I would think that , you know , I mean you can be persuaded .\nthe father: I don't think , you know , you know , ...\nthe child: in my house .\nthe investigator: uhhuh well evidently , the problem may not have been so much with the principal , but it might have been more with the teacher .\nthe child: .\nthe investigator: some of the teacher seems to feel that they're the ones that are being observed , see ?\nthe investigator: and I could care less about the teachers .\nthe investigator: and once once I I'm in that situation I think they realize that I'm not I'm not paying attention to them , for the most part .\nthe investigator: but ...\nthe child: .\nthe father: Tony .\nthe investigator: you wanna do it ?\nthe father: Tony leave it alone let Carl
